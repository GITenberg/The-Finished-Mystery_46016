        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the days of
        the Apostles, Christian people have been looking for the coming of
        our Lord Jesus in great power and glory; for He said that He would
        come again and receive His Church unto Himself. He further pointed
        out that for some time prior to the completion of the Church He would
        be present, gathering out from Babylon and from the world the truly
        consecrated, and that during His presence <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Mystery of God”</span> would be finished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through St. John
        the Lord Jesus revealed the fact that the Church would be developed
        during seven distinct periods, or epochs; and that for each of these
        epochs He would have a special angel, or messenger, to serve the
        other members of the Body. It follows, then, that the messenger to
        the last, or Laodicean, epoch would declare the Presence of the Lord
        and the time of the Harvest of the Gospel Age. The great Master laid
        special emphasis on the importance of the messenger to the seventh,
        or Laodicean, period of the Church, saying that such an one would be
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord
        would make ruler over all His Household, to give them meat in due
        season.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those consecrated
        Christians who have read and fully appreciated the Truth as contained
        in the preceding six volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES readily see
        and agree that Charles Taze Russell was the messenger of the Church
        of Laodicea. In the mind of every one who believes the Bible the
        evidence set forth in this volume will establish that fact beyond the
        question of a doubt.</p>

        Divine Prophecy, now being daily fulfilled and made clear to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the watchers,”</span> the following from the
        pen of Pastor Russell is further proof that he was sent of God to
        this generation. Long years before the beginning of the trouble now
        upon the nations he wrote:</p>

        the families of the earth. These are:</span></span></p>

          shall divide kingdoms (mountains)—prefigured by the mighty wind
          shown to Elijah (1 Kings 19:11), which rent the rocks. But God's
          Kingdom will not follow the epoch of war; the world will not thus
          be made ready for the Reign of Immanuel. No; a further lesson will
          be needed and will be given. It is represented in</span></span></p>

          Throughout the Scriptures an earthquake seems always to represent
          revolution; and it is not unreasonable to expect that an era of
          general warfare would so arouse the lower classes of Europe and so
          discontent them with their lot (and especially with the conditions
          which would follow such a war) that revolution would be the next
          thing in order. (Rev. 16:18.) But, severe though those
          revolutionary experiences will be to the world, they are not
          sufficient to prepare men to hear the voice of God. It will

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1879 Charles
        Taze Russell began the publication of THE WATCH TOWER, of which he
        was the sole editor as long as he remained on earth. THE WATCH TOWER
        was, and is, the first and only journal declaring the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presence</span></em>
        of the Lord Jesus. Pastor Russell being the messenger to the
        Laodicean Church, and occupying the position of the Lord's special
        servant to give the Household of Faith meat in due season, it was to
        be expected that he would bring forth from the Lord's great
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Storehouse”</span> the needed spiritual food
        for the Church, in harmony with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> God's will. By the Lord's grace he wrote the
        six volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, which writings, aside from
        the Bible, have gladdened more hearts and thrilled Christians with
        greater hope and joyful expectation than have any other writings
        extant. These books have been properly designated <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Keys to the Divine Plan of the Ages.”</span> These
        <span class="tei tei-q">“keys”</span> have been placed in the hands
        of thousands of Christian people throughout the world, and have
        enabled them to unlock the Lord's Treasure-house, the Bible, and
        there to see some of the <span class="tei tei-q">“treasures of
        wisdom”</span> and knowledge of God! Some have been able to use these
        <span class="tei tei-q">“keys”</span> more effectually than have
        others. <span class="tei tei-q">“God hath set the members in the Body
        as it hath pleased Him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time and again
        Pastor Russell said that the Seventh Volume of STUDIES IN THE
        SCRIPTURES would be written; and it was expected that he would write
        it. The Scriptures show that the Seventh Volume must be published.
        Pastor Russell passed from the earth, and the Seventh Volume remained
        unpublished. In his last moments he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Some one else can write the Seventh Volume.”</span> For
        any one to arrogate to himself the authority to write and publish the
        Seventh Volume would, we believe, seem presumptuous before the Lord.
        Whom, then, would the Lord have to write it?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pastor Russell was
        a man of unusual modesty. Great men usually are modest. The
        examination of the contents of this book will disclose the fact that
        it deals with Revelation and Ezekiel; that the Lord long ago caused
        to be recorded therein, in symbolic language, a history of the
        Church, particularly the closing earthly experiences thereof; that
        therein He set forth that He would uncover the frauds, deceptions and
        blasphemous teachings and practices of the church nominal—both
        Catholic and Protestant; that in the last days He would then make
        bare the unholy alliance between the unrighteous ecclesiastical
        systems and the corrupt political elements of the earth, which
        religious systems have prospered and grown fat in the name of Christ;
        that the Lord pronounces His indignation and wrath against all such
        Babylonish systems and marks their utter destruction in a Time of
        Trouble such as the world has never known and will never again know;
        and that the earthly creature made prominent therein above all others
        is the messenger of the Laodicean Church—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that wise and faithful servant”</span> of the
        Lord—CHARLES TAZE RUSSELL. In view of the facts stated, is it at all
        surprising that the Lord spared him the publication of the Seventh
        Volume?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the fact is,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he did
        write it</span></em>. This book may properly be said to be a
        posthumous publication of Pastor Russell. <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Why? Because to him the Lord gave the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“key”</span>; to him was given the privilege
        of making clear to the Church in its last years the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Mystery of God”</span>; to him was granted the privilege
        of hearing from the hands of the Lord to the Household of Faith
        <span class="tei tei-q">“meat in due season”</span> for the special
        development and sustenance of God's dear little ones. This service he
        has faithfully performed. This book is chiefly a compilation of
        things which he wrote and which have been brought together in
        harmonious style by properly applying the symbols which he explained
        to the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By his last Will
        and Testament Pastor Russell designated George H. Fisher, of
        Scranton, Pa., as one whom he would approve as a member of the
        Editorial Staff of THE WATCH TOWER—the most important journal
        published on earth. For many years Brother Fisher has been
        consecrated to the Lord, a careful student of the Bible in the light
        of the Message brought from the Lord by the messenger to the
        Laodicean Church; and for some time he has made a careful and
        prayerful study of the Book of Ezekiel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Pastor
        Russell was with us he gave direction that the BIBLE STUDENTS MANUAL
        should be prepared by Clayton J. Woodworth, also of Scranton, Pa.
        This Manual was published by this Society, and has proven a great
        blessing to the Household of Faith. The preparation of that Manual
        required a critical examination of everything Pastor Russell had
        written; and thus Brother Woodworth was enabled to become more
        familiar, probably, than any one else with the explanation of the
        Scriptures which had been given by Brother Russell. In this manner
        the Lord seemed to have qualified him for some special work. With the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“key”</span> which Brother Russell, as the
        Lord's servant, had placed in his hands, Brother Woodworth, by the
        Lord's grace, has been enabled to bring together everything that
        Brother Russell wrote on Revelation, and to explain and harmonize the
        other parts of that book with the Divine Plan; also, to treat
        similarly, the Song of Solomon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed pleasing
        to the Lord that Brothers C. J. Woodworth and George H. Fisher should
        prepare the Seventh Volume, under the direction of the WATCH TOWER
        BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY. While both residing in the same city, they
        have worked separate and apart from each other, not even comparing
        notes. The reader will be able to judge how fully the work of each
        harmonizes with that of the other and with the Divine Plan, thus
        giving further evidence of the Lord's direction in this matter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pastor Russell
        long ago said, in substance, that the Seventh Volume would not be for
        the development of the Church; that the preceding <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em>
        volumes of STUDIES IN <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
        007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> THE
        SCRIPTURES contain the necessary spiritual food for that purpose.
        Asked why, then, it would be written, he replied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">It will probably be given to the Church in a
        time of direst need, for her comfort and
        encouragement</span></span>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who amongst the
        consecrated this side the veil does not realize that the Church is
        now in that time of <span class="tei tei-q">“dire need of comfort and
        encouragement”</span>? The hour of fiery trial and great testings is
        upon God's people, and there is need for their comfort and
        encouragement. The Lord has promised <span class="tei tei-q">“grace
        sufficient”</span> and help for every time of need for those who love
        Him and come confidently unto Him. We believe that as the Lord's dear
        children throughout the earth read the contents of this book and see
        how wonderfully He has shielded them from the storms of human passion
        and from the snares of the great Adversary; and that when they see
        that the unrighteous, wicked systems of Babylon are now crumbling
        under the mighty hand of God—which bespeaks the early deliverance of
        the last members of the Body from this vale of tears into the
        glorious light and liberty of the saints—that then they will be
        greatly comforted; that then they will take new courage and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“gird up the loins of their mind, be sober
        and hope to the end for the grace that is to come unto them
        quickly;”</span> that with exceeding joy they will lift up their
        heads, because the hour of deliverance is at hand! To all the truly
        consecrated who read and appreciate this book we believe that the
        words of the Master, <span class="tei tei-q">“THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN
        IS AT HAND!”</span> will sound in their ears like clarion notes upon
        the clear morning air, giving courage and strength to those who are
        growing weak in faith, and more courage to the stronger ones. We
        believe that every one who appreciates this volume will have a
        burning desire to grasp his weapon and go forth to the smiting of the
        Jordan, giving praise to the Lord for the privilege.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some will murmur
        and find fault with this book; some will grow angry, and some will
        join the persecutors. But, we believe, every saint whose heart is
        filled with love for God and for His people will rejoice and give
        praise to the Lord for this further evidence of His blessed
        favor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The publisher
        takes pleasure in presenting this, the Seventh Volume, to the
        remaining members of the Church, and to all who may read with profit
        to themselves and to the glory of the Lord Jesus and our Father. As
        the Lord has sent forth the other six volumes, His blessing has
        accompanied each. That His blessing may be upon this volume, to the
        comfort and encouragement of the dear saints in the hour of direst
        need, is our prayer!</p>

          at Jerusalem, Antioch, Corinth, Colosse, Philippi, Thessalonica,

          stars.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Apparently the stars
          represent special ministers, or servants of the Church. In
          Revelation 12:1 the Church is pictured as a Woman crowned with
          twelve stars. These stars evidently represent the Twelve Apostles
          as the special lights of the Church. Similarly, in the picture
          before us, the seven stars which the Lord holds in His right hand
          seem to represent special light-bearers in the Church—in each of
          its seven phases, or stages, of development. It will be noticed
          that the messages to the various Churches are sent by these stars,
          messengers, angels, as though our Lord would have us understand
          that the appropriate message for each appropriate epoch in the
          Church's experience would be sent by the Lord through a particular
          star, or messenger, whom He would especially commission as His
          representative. Our Lord Himself is represented by the great light
          of the sun; and His special messengers in the Church throughout the
          entire period of the Gospel Age are consistently enough represented
          as stars.”</span>—Z. '16-345; Rev. 1:20.</p>

          mouth went a sharp two-edged sword.</span></span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No part of the description could more thoroughly
          convince us that the description of our Lord given here is
          symbolic. As a symbolic picture, it speaks to us of the Word of the
          Lord, the Sword of the Spirit, <span class="tei tei-q">‘sharper
          than any two-edged sword.’</span> (Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12.) It
          reminds us that our Lord's words are not one-sided, not directed
          merely against sin in one class, but that His Word is sharp,
          cutting in every direction; that sin is reproved by Him as much
          when found in His most earnest followers as when found elsewhere.
          It assures us that none need attempt to pluck out the mote from his
          brother's eye without first getting rid of the beam in his own eye;
          and that if we do not show mercy to those who are our debtors we
          must not expect mercy from Him who has purposed to extend His mercy
          toward us. How heart-searching is God's Word when we understand
          it—not merely as a compendium of rules and regulations, but when we
          catch the spirit of it! Then we come to see that its requirement is
          love out of a pure heart; first, to the Heavenly Father; secondly,
          to our Lord and Head; thirdly, to all His brethren; fourthly, to
          the world in general, groaning and travailing in pain, waiting for
          the blessings of the coming Day of Christ; and fifthly, toward our
          enemies also, sympathetically realizing that they are warped,
          twisted and blinded through the deceitfulness of sin and through
          the machinations of the great Adversary.—2 Cor. 4:4.”</span>—Z.

          a glimpse of the glories of the Divine Character. When once we get
          a true view of Him with whom we have to do, as the great
          Heart-searcher and Caretaker of His Church, we fall before Him,

          of special value to the Church while the Papacy was rising into
          power was Arius. He <span class="tei tei-q">“maintained that the
          Son of God was totally and essentially distinct from the Father;
          that He was the first and noblest of those beings whom God had
          created—the instrument by whose subordinate operation He formed the
          Universe; and therefore inferior to the Father both in nature and
          dignity.”</span> (Buck.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The controversy
          spread like a flame throughout the empire. Accordingly the first
          ecumenical council was held at Nice, A. D. 325, consisting of 318
          bishops, most of whom were from the East. The gist of the question
          to be settled by the Council of Nice lay in the argument of Arius:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Father is a father; the Son is a son;
          therefore the Father must have existed before the Son; therefore
          once the Son was not; therefore He was made, like all creatures, of
          a substance that had not previously existed.’</span> The creed, as
          finally adopted, condemned the heresy of Arius and fixed the
          doctrine as it has been held in the church to this day. Of all the
          bishops only Thomas of Marmarica, and Secundus of Ptolemais, held
          out against the threat of banishment by the Emperor. Arius was
          excommunicated and banished, and his books burnt.”</span>—McC.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          accepted, A. D. 325, there was practically no more Bible study for
          over twelve centuries. During all that time Bible study was
          considered unnecessary, because the Apostolic Bishops had
          formulated the creeds as proper statements of the Church's faith.
          To study the Bible would have meant the studying of how to fight
          against the Emperor and the bishops.”</span> (Z. '15-253.)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“As a result of the failure of these
          bishops to stand by the Word of the Lord, God's people for
          centuries have been confessing a Divine trinity, which is
          incomprehensible; and meantime been neglecting the trinity taught
          by the Bible, which is more reasonable. If the trinity of the
          creeds was questioned, hands were lifted in horror, and the
          questioner was told that the subject was a mystery, which he could
          not possibly understand, but to doubt which would mean his
          damnation! The mysterious proposition was sometimes stated to be 3
          × 1 is 1; but others stated <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          incapable of understanding such mathematics, and too honest to
          confess and profess what they could not believe!”</span> (B. S. M.)

          and the Goths out of Italy, by the arms of Justinian. However, it
          revived again in Italy, under the protection of the Lombards, in
          the seventh century, and was not extinguished till about the end of
          the eighth. Arianism was revived in the West by Servetus, in 1531,
          for which he suffered death.”</span>—Buck.</p>

          embellished during a succession of years by kings who all had a
          passion for expenditure and ample means of gratifying

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The first ecumenical council of Nice
          (325), in its sixth canon, makes only an incidental mention of the
          Roman bishop. The first pope, in the real sense, was Leo I
          (440-461). The bishops of the African and the Spanish churches
          submitted to his demands, and he gained an important foothold even
          in the East. In Gaul, however, he met with a most determined
          resistance. Gregory I (590-604) saw that the bishops of Rome could
          not enjoy the ecclesiastical supremacy at which they aimed until
          they threw off their political dependency. The triumph of the
          Catholic Church over Arianism in Spain greatly promoted his plans;
          but he did not as yet actually possess the power of the mediaeval
          popes. In the seventh and eighth centuries a series of important
          events gave the popes a high and influential position among the
          secular governments of the world. The actual power was, however,
          for several centuries, not commensurate with their claims and
          aspirations. In 1073, Hildebrand (Gregory VII), after being for
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name=
          "Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> about twenty-five
          years the guide of the Papal policy, boldly set forth the theory of
          a theocratic rule of the pope over all the nations of the world.
          The period from Gregory VII onward is an almost continuous conflict
          between the popes and the secular governments, during which the
          former, with an iron firmness, endeavored at first to destroy the
          direct influence of the princes upon the church, and secondly, to
          subject all secular governments to the church. This conflict was
          ended by the Concordat of Worms (1122), by which Emperor Henry V,
          after the precedence of the governments of England and France,
          surrendered <span class="tei tei-q">‘to God, to St. Peter and Paul,
          and to the Catholic Church, all right of
          investiture.’</span> ”</span> (McC.) The Pergamos (<span class=

          "tei tei-q">“learned”</span> volumes have been written in the
          effort to make this pretty snarl clear to the Roman clergy. It is
          clear enough to others. <span class="tei tei-q">“Saint”</span>
          Agathon, 678-682, claimed to be a miracle worker. He was the
          infallible pope who denounced the doctrines taught by infallible
          Honorius I. <span class="tei tei-q">“Saint”</span> Nicholas I,
          858-867, <span class="tei tei-q">“tamed kings and tyrants, and
          ruled the world like a sovereign; to the wicked and unconverted he
          was a terror.”</span> So says a Catholic historian. John VIII,
          872-882, must have seriously offended one of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“brethren”</span> at the Vatican; for that dignitary
          first tried to poison him, and as the poison did not work quickly
          enough, he finished the job by breaking John's head with a hammer.
          Stephen VII, 897-898, was offended because his predecessor had at
          one time gotten the papal throne away from him. Accordingly, his
          first act was to cause the body of Pope Formosus to be exhumed,
          mutilated and thrown into the Tiber. Subsequently one of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brethren”</span> strangled him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christopher,
          900-903, boldly deposed his predecessor, Leo V, declaring him unfit
          to reign, which was doubtless true. Leo died <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of grief”</span> in prison less than forty days after
          he had ascended the throne. He probably had something given him to
          help his grief along. Christopher himself was murdered by
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">his</span></em> successor. Sergius III,
          904-911, having murdered Christopher, ascended the throne and
          emulated the kings of earlier days. His concubine Marosia bore him
          several children. John X, 915-928, and Leo VI, 928-929, were both
          killed by Marosia, to make room for others in whom she was
          interested. John XI, 931-936, was the son of Marosia by Pope
          Sergius III. One of the <span class="tei tei-q">“brethren”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name=
          "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> poisoned him. John
          XII, 956-964, was murdered while in the act of committing adultery.
          He was of licentious habits, associating with women of every
          station, and filling the Lateran with the noisy profanity of a
          brothel. Among his mistresses was Joan, popularly known in history
          as Pope Joan. She was a brilliant woman and actually exercised the
          chief influence at Rome during John's pontificate. Benedict VI,
          972-973, was strangled or poisoned by one of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“saints.”</span> Boniface VII, 984-985, was elected
          just after the tumult caused by the death of Benedict VI, but had
          to leave town to escape a similar fate, on account of
          licentiousness and cruelty. He remained away eleven years,
          returned, put Pope John XIV in prison, starved him to death and
          ascended the throne in his place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gregory V,
          996-999, was poisoned by one of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“regularly ordained”</span> clergy. Benedict IX,
          1033-1045, the boy pope whose parents bought the popedom for him
          when he was twelve years old, was the worst monster that ever held
          the papal throne. Some, however, claim that honor for Alexander VI,
          1492-1503, who had seven acknowledged bastards and many mistresses.
          Alexander tried to poison nine cardinals at one sitting so that he
          could sell their offices for the benefit of his brood; but a stupid
          servant gave him the wrong glass and he departed this life ahead of
          time. Benedict's vile conduct caused the Romans to expel him from
          the city. Silvester III was regularly elected to take his place;
          but after three months Benedict came back and resumed control.
          Shortly afterward he sold the popedom to Gregory VI, so that he
          might be free to marry an Italian princess. At one time there were
          three popes living in Rome contemporaneously, and the city was
          filled with brawls and murders. A fourth, Clement II, was elected,
          but after he had served nine months, a friend of Gregory put
          something into his food besides the regular seasoning; and he never
          awoke again. Thereupon Benedict came back and reigned three years
          longer.</p>

          Valdensis, or Valdisius, from Vaux, or Waldum, a town in the
          marquisate of Lyons, being extremely zealous for the advancement of
          true piety and Christian knowledge, employed a certain priest,
          called Stephanus de Evisa, about the year 1160, in translating,
          from Latin into French, the four Gospels, with other books of Holy
          Scripture. But no sooner had he perused these sacred books with a
          proper degree of attention, than he perceived that the religion
          which was now taught in the Roman church differed totally from that
          which was originally inculcated by Christ and His Apostles. Struck
          with this glaring contradiction between the doctrines of the
          pontiffs and the truths of the Gospel, and animated with zeal, he
          abandoned his mercantile vocation, distributed his riches among the
          poor (whence the Waldenses were called poor men of Lyons), and
          forming an association with other pious men who had adopted his
          sentiments and his turn of devotion, he began to assume the quality
          of a public teacher, and to instruct the multitude in the doctrines
          and precepts of Christianity.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          ministry, the archbishop of Lyons, and the other rulers of the

          opposition was unsuccessful; for the purity and simplicity of that
          religion which these good men taught, the spotless innocence that
          shone forth in their lives and actions, and the noble contempt of
          riches and honors which was conspicuous in the whole of their
          conduct and conversation, appeared so engaging to all such as had
          any sense of true piety, that the number of their followers daily
          increased. They accordingly formed religious assemblies, first in
          France, and afterwards in Lombardy; from whence they propagated
          their sect throughout the other provinces of Europe with incredible
          rapidity, and with such invincible fortitude that neither fire nor
          sword, nor the most cruel inventions of merciless persecution,
          could damp their zeal, or entirely ruin their cause. All they aimed
          at was to reduce the form of ecclesiastical government, and the
          manners both of the clergy and the people, to that amiable
          simplicity and primitive sanctity which characterized the Apostolic
          ages, and which appear so strongly recommended in the precepts and

          the Roman church had degenerated from its primitive purity and
          sanctity. They denied the supremacy of the Roman pontiff, and
          maintained that the rulers and ministers of the Church were
          obliged, by their vocation, to imitate the poverty of the Apostles
          and to procure for themselves a subsistence by the work of their
          hands. They considered every Christian as, in a certain measure,
          qualified and authorized to instruct, exhort and confirm the
          brethren in their Christian course. They at the same time affirmed
          that confession made to priests was by no means necessary, since
          the humble offender might acknowledge his sins and testify his
          repentance to any true believer, and might expect from such the
          counsel and admonition which his case demanded. They maintained
          that the power of delivering sinners from the guilt and punishment
          of their offenses belonged to God alone; and that indulgences in
          consequence were the criminal invention of sordid avarice. They
          looked upon the prayers and other ceremonies that were instituted
          in behalf of the dead, as vain, useless, and absurd, and denied the
          existence of departed souls in an intermediate state of
          purification. It is also said that several of the Waldenses denied
          the obligation of infant baptism. They adopted as the model of
          their moral discipline Christ's sermon on the mount, which they
          interpreted and explained in the most rigorous and literal manner;

          was the first appearance of the Scriptures in any modern language.
          The possession of these books soon discovered to Waldo that the
          Church was never designed to be dependent on a priesthood, even for
          the administration of the sacraments; and he became so obnoxious to
          the church that he was anathematized by the pope. No longer safe in
          Lyons, Waldo and his friends took refuge in the mountains, and
          there formed those communities from which the simple doctrines of
          Christianity flowed out all over Europe. Provence, Languedoc,
          Flanders, Germany, one after another tasted of the refreshing
          waters. Waldo traveled in Picardy, teaching his reformation
          doctrines, hundreds of years before Luther was born. He finally
          settled in Bohemia, where he died in 1179, the same year in which
          his tenets were denounced by an ecumenical council. The Waldensian
          Church was a light on the mountains during the Dark

          The 360 years from Waldo's message in 1160 ended in 1520. Luther's
          95 theses were placed on the church doors at Wittenberg October 31,
          1517. <span class="tei tei-q">“These he proposed not as points
          fully established, but as subjects of inquiry and disputation. The
          learned were invited to impugn them, either in person or by
          writing; and to the whole he subjoined solemn protestations of his
          high respect for the apostolic see, and of his implicit submission
          to his authority. No opponent appeared at the time prefixed; the
          theses spread over Germany with astonishing rapidity, and were read
          with the greatest eagerness.”</span> (Buck.) Luther was summoned in
          July, 1518, to appear at Rome within sixty days. He wrote a
          submissive letter to the pope, requesting a trial in Germany.
          Meantime the German Emperor died; and the pope, absorbed in the
          choice of a new emperor, paid little heed to the Luther
          controversy.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“From the reason just now given, a suspension of
          proceeding against Luther took place for eighteen months, though
          perpetual negotiations were carried on. The manner in which these
          were conducted having given our reformer many opportunities of
          observing the corruption of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the court of Rome, its obstinacy in adhering
          to established errors, and its indifference about truth, he began
          in 1520 to utter some doubts with regard to the Divine origin of
          the papal authority, which he publicly disputed with Eccius, one of
          his most learned and formidable antagonists. The papal authority
          being once suspected, Luther proceeded to push on his inquiries and
          attacks from one doctrine to another, till at last he began to
          shake the foundations on which the wealth and power of the church
          were established. Leo then began to perceive that there were no
          hopes of reclaiming such an incorrigible heretic, and therefore
          prepared to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against him.
          The college of cardinals was often assembled, in order to prepare
          the sentence with due deliberation; and the ablest canonists were
          consulted how it might be expressed with unexceptionable formality.
          At last it was issued, on the 15th of June, 1520. Forty-one
          propositions, extracted out of Luther's works, were therein
          condemned as heretical, scandalous, and offensive to pious ears;
          all persons were forbidden to read his writings, upon pain of
          excommunication; such as had any of them in their custody were
          commanded to commit them to the flames; he himself, if he did not
          within sixty days publicly recant his errors, and burn his books,
          was pronounced an obstinate heretic, excommunicated, and delivered
          to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; and all secular princes
          were required, under pain of incurring the same censure, to seize
          his person, that he might be punished as his crimes
          deserved.”</span> (Buck.) With the excommunication of Luther,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the fat was in the fire”</span>; and it
          was useless for the Roman Catholic Church to try to stem the tide

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          [unto] BY the angel.</span></span>—The next important messenger to
          the Church was John Wycliffe. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was in
          1378 A. D., the year of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Great Schism
          of the West,’</span> when two popes were elected, one in Rome and
          the other in Avignon, that Wycliffe came out as the great Doctrinal
          Reformer. Workman, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dawn of the Reformation</span></span>, writes:
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Wycliffe's spiritual earnestness was
          shocked, his theory destroyed by the spectacle of two popes, each
          claiming to be the sole head of the Church, each labeling the other
          as Antichrist. To Wycliffe, the year of the Schism, 1378, was the
          crucial year of his life. He first urged that both popes should be
          set aside as having little in common with the Church of the Holy
          God. From this position of neutrality he quickly passed into one of
          antagonism to the Papacy itself.’</span> In his <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mediaeval Church
          History</span></span>, Archbishop Trench says: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘The year 1378 marked the turning-point in Wycliffe's
          career. Hitherto he had concerned himself with matters of mixed
          ecclesiastical and political import, but henceforth he devoted
          himself exclusively to doctrinal matters and came out as the
          Reformer. He began in earnest the translation of the Bible into
          English, and took the next decisive step by an open attack, forced
          upon him by his studies of the Bible, against
          Transubstantiation.’</span> Wycliffe thus attacked the very bulwark
          of Antichrist's stronghold, for the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
          or the sacrifice of the Mass, annulled the true sacrifice of
          Christ. Because of this, the Papal system became in God's sight the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘desolating abomination.’</span> (Dan.

          Arius died a natural death; as did Peter Waldo, John Wycliffe,
          Martin Luther and Charles T. Russell, although all had reason to
          expect martyrdom at the hands of ecclesiasticism. The year that
          Peter Waldo died, his tenets were condemned by an ecumenical
          council. <span class="tei tei-q">“Wycliffe preached unmolested; but
          the Council of Constance (May 5, 1415) condemned his doctrines, and
          in 1428 his remains were dug up and burned; the ashes were cast
          into the adjoining Swift, which, as Wordsworth poetically remarked,
          conveyed them through the Avon and the Severn into the sea, and
          thus disseminated them over the world. His doctrines, carried into
          Bohemia, originated the Hussite movement. The New Testament was
          published about 1378, and the entire Old Testament was completed
          shortly before his death.”</span>—McC.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nailing up that paper was the beginning of

          liberties of men; of thirty years continuous war in Germany; of
          Paris and the vine-clad valleys of Italy drenched in blood; of
          fires kindled all over England for the burning of men, women and

          with all this, the advance of justice, truth and liberty, the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The theses ran through all Germany in

          whose appearance is foretold in the New Testament; declaimed
          against his tyranny with greater vehemence than ever; and at last

          [unto] BY the angel.</span></span>—The special messenger to the
          last Age of the Church was Charles T. Russell, born February 16,
          1852. He has privately admitted his belief that he was chosen for
          his great work from before his birth. His mother died when he was
          nine years old; and at the age of eleven Charles formed a business
          partnership with his father, himself writing the articles of
          agreement under which they transacted business. When he was but
          twelve years of age, his father found him in the store one time at
          2 a. m., poring over a concordance, unconscious of the lapse of
          time. We give some extracts from his autobiography:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We begin the narrative at the year 1868, when the
          Editor, having been a consecrated child of God for some years, and
          a member of the Congregational Church and of the Y. M. C. A., began
          to be shaken in faith regarding many long accepted doctrines.
          Brought up a Presbyterian, indoctrinated from the catechism, and
          being naturally of an inquiring mind, I fell a ready prey to the
          logic of infidelity, as soon as I began to think for myself. But
          that which at first threatened to be the utter shipwreck of faith
          in God and the Bible, was, under God's providence, overruled for
          good, and merely wrecked my confidence in human creeds and systems
          of Bible interpretations. I was led gradually to see that though
          each of the creeds contained some elements of Truth, they were, on
          the whole, misleading and contradictory of God's Word. Among other
          theories, I stumbled upon Adventism. Seemingly by accident, one
          evening I dropped into a dusty, dingy hall in Allegheny, Pa., where
          I had heard that religious services were held, to see if the
          handful who met there had anything more sensible to offer than the
          creeds of the great churches. There, for the first time, I heard
          something of the views of Second Adventism, by Jonas Wendell, long
          since deceased. Thus I confess indebtedness to Adventists as well
          as to other Bible students. Though his Scripture exposition was not
          entirely clear, and though it was very far from what we now rejoice
          in, it was sufficient, under God, to reestablish my wavering faith
          in the Divine inspiration of the Bible, and to show that the
          records of the Apostles and the Prophets are indissolubly
          linked.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When in 1872 I came to examine the subject of
          Restitution from the standpoint of the Ransom-price given by our
          Lord Jesus for Adam, and consequently for all lost in Adam, it
          settled the matter of Restitution completely, and gave me the
          fullest assurance that ALL <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">must come forth</span></em> from their graves
          and be brought to a clear knowledge <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Truth and to a full opportunity to
          gain everlasting life through Christ. The years following, to 1876,
          were years of continued growth in grace and in knowledge on the
          part of the handful of Bible students with whom I met in Allegheny.
          We progressed from our first crude and indefinite ideas of
          Restitution to clearer understanding of the details; but God's due
          time for clear light had not yet come. During this time, too, we
          came to recognize the difference between our Lord as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Man</span></em> who gave Himself,’</span> and
          as the One who would come again, a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit
          Being</span></em>. We saw that spirit beings can be present and yet
          invisible to men.... It seems that not long after their 1874
          disappointment, a reader of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Herald of the Morning</span></span>, who
          had a copy of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Emphatic Diaglott</span></span>, noticed
          something in it which he thought peculiar—that in Matthew 24:27,
          37, 39, the Greek word <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign"
          xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">parousia</span></span>, which in our Common
          Version is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">coming</span></em>,’</span> is in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Diaglott</span></span> translated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">presence</span></em>’</span>—evidently the
          correct translation of the Greek. This was the clue; and following
          it, they had been led through prophetic <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">time</span></em>
          toward proper views regarding the object and manner of our Lord's
          Return, and then to the examination of the time when the things
          indicated in God's Word as related to Christ's <span lang="el"
          class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">parousia</span></span> should take place. Thus
          God leads His children often from different starting points of
          Truth. But where the heart is earnest and trustful, the results
          must be to draw all together.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There were no books or other publications setting
          forth the time prophecies as then understood. So I paid Mr.
          Barbour's expenses to come to see me at Philadelphia (where I had
          business engagements during the summer of 1876), to show me fully
          and Scripturally, if he could, that the prophecies indicated 1874
          as the date at which the Lord's <em class=

          came, and the evidence satisfied me. Being a person of positive
          convictions, and fully consecrated to the Lord, I at once saw that
          the special times in which we live have an important bearing upon
          our duty and work as Christ's disciples; that since we are living
          in the time of the Harvest, the Harvest work should be done; and
          that Present Truth is the sickle by which the Lord would have us do
          a reaping work everywhere among His children. I inquired of Mr.
          Barbour as to what was being done by him and <span class=

          were present; all of the ministers of the two cities refused to
          believe. In the same year he determined to give up secular work and
          devote his entire time and fortune to the work indicated in the
          Scriptures as incident to the close of the Gospel Age and change of

          course was in harmony with the Scriptures, and also as a means of
          demonstrating his own sincerity, he decided to test the Lord's
          approval as follows: (1) Devote his life to the cause; (2) Invest
          his fortune in the promulgation of the work; (3) Prohibit

          able to spell out a few Greek words is of no earthly value. Nor is
          it necessary longer to study these languages in order to have

          Lexicon Concordance, which any one may procure. And our Methodist
          friends have issued a similar work—Strong's Analytical Concordance
          and Lexicon. And there is a still older one entitled Englishman's
          Hebrew, Chaldaic, Greek and English Lexicon and Concordance.
          Additionally, Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon is a standard

          original text of the Bible is obtainable. I have all four of these
          works and have used them faithfully. Very few college professors,
          even, would risk to give a critical translation of any text of
          Scripture without consulting these very works of reference, which
          are standard. Additionally I remind you of the many translations of
          the Bible now extant—all of them very good. I have all of these and
          find them useful in comparison and study of any text—one

          thought which another may not. The other day, for curiosity's sake,
          I counted Bibles in different translations, etc., in my study, and
          found that I have thirty-two.”</span>—Z. '14-286.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to his
          ordination we quote him again: <span class="tei tei-q">“There are
          two ordinations proper. One is of God; one of men. The ordination
          of God is the begetting of the Holy Spirit. If any are preaching
          without this ordination, they are doing something that they are not
          authorized to do. There comes, however, another special ordination
          of those who are called ministers of the Gospel, in which class I
          count myself. This is ordination by the Church, and is recognized
          by all denominations everywhere. By some it is considered a mere
          form, by some it is performed with great ceremony, by others with
          less ceremony. But to our understanding, each congregation should
          have those whom it has chosen ordained in a Scriptural way—by the
          stretching forth of hands—by a vote. Whoever has not been ordained
          in these two ways is not an ordained minister of the Gospel in the
          Scriptural sense. First, the Divine ordination is necessary;
          second, the earthly ordination is necessary. By the grace of God I
          have both of these.”</span>—Z. '15-358.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to his
          doctrines we quote him the third time: <span class="tei tei-q">“To
          us the Scriptures clearly teach that the Church is the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Temple of the living God’</span>—peculiarly
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘His workmanship’</span>; its construction
          has been in progress throughout the Gospel Age—ever since Christ
          became the world's Redeemer and Chief Corner Stone of His Temple,
          through which, when finished, God's blessing shall come
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘to all people,’</span> and they find
          access to Him. (1 Cor. 3:16, 17; Eph. 2:20; Gen. 28:14; Gal. 3:29.)
          That meantime the chiseling, shaping and polishing of consecrated
          believers in Christ's Atonement for sin progresses; and when the
          last of these <span class="tei tei-q">‘living stones,’</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘elect and precious,’</span> shall have
          been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together
          in the First Resurrection; and the Temple shall be filled with His
          glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the
          Millennium. (Rev. 15:6-8; 21:3.) We affirm the pre-existence of
          Jesus as the mighty Word (Logos)—Spokesman—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the beginning of the creation of God,’</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the First-Born of every creature,’</span>
          the active Agent of the Heavenly Father, Jehovah, in all the work
          of creation. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Without Him was not anything
          made that was made.’</span> (Rev. 3:14; Col. 1:15; John 1:3.) We
          affirm that the Word (Logos) was made flesh—became the Babe of
          Bethlehem—thus becoming the Man Jesus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
          sinners.’</span> As we affirm the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Divinity of Christ—<span class="tei tei-q">‘God also hath highly
          exalted Him, and given Him a name above every name.’</span> (Heb.
          7:26; Phil. 2:9.)</span></p>

          and is manifested in all who receive the begetting of the Holy
          Spirit and thereby become sons of God. (John 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:3.) We
          affirm the resurrection of Christ—that He was put to death in flesh
          but quickened in Spirit. We deny that He was raised in the flesh,
          and challenge any statement to that effect as being unscriptural.
          (1 Pet. 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:8; Acts 26:13-15.) That the

          perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop
          in herself every grace; to be God's witness to the world; and to
          prepare to be kings and priests in the next Age. (Eph. 4:12; Matt.
          24:14; Rev. 1:6; 20:6.) That the Hope for the World lies in the
          blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to all by
          Christ's Millennial Kingdom—the Restitution of all that was lost in
          Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their
          Redeemer and His glorified Church—when all the wilfully wicked
          shall be destroyed. (Acts 3:19-23; Isa. 35.)”</span>—B. S. M.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The amount of
          work that Pastor Russell performed <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
          incredible</span></em>, and it is doubtful whether it was ever
          equalled by any other human being. When he was in his twenties he
          was refused the lease of a property because the owner thought he
          would surely die before the lease had expired. For fifty years he
          suffered constantly with sick headaches, due to a fall in his
          youth, and for twenty-five years had such distressing hemorrhoids
          that it was impossible for him to rest in the easiest chair; yet in
          the past forty years he traveled a million miles, delivered 30,000
          sermons and table talks—many of them 2-½ hours long—wrote over
          50,000 pages (of this size) of advanced Biblical exposition, often
          dictated 1,000 letters per month, managed every department of a
          world-wide evangelistic campaign employing 700 speakers, personally
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name=
          "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> compiled the most
          wonderful Biblical drama ever shown; and with all that, he found
          time in the course of each year to personally aid thousands with
          his fatherly counsel. At one time his writings were subjected to an
          analysis of 20,511 Scripture expositions. These were assembled in
          Biblical order and disclosed but six points of inquiry, all easily
          harmonized. No writer, not even excepting the writers of the Bible,
          have ever had such critical readers. His works have been published
          in 35 languages. During the last eight days of his life he had
          appointments in California, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and New
          York; and though for several days manifestly dying, with cystitis
          (caused by excessive travel and speaking), he declined to cancel
          any engagements, and went out of this life October 31, 1916, on a
          railroad train en route to his Kansas appointment. At the age of 30
          he had accumulated a fortune of over $300,000, but died penniless,
          his own fortune, as well as all the large sums contributed to the
          cause, having been used up in the Master's service. He was beloved
          everywhere by those who <span class="tei tei-q">“follow the Lamb

          succeeded in pulling the wool over the eyes of the common people;
          but that the last age of the Church is Laodicean (<span lang="el"

          much better without the clergy than we did with them. The Laodicean
          period of the Church extends from the fall of 1874 to the spring of
          1918, three and one-half years of preparation, and forty years of
          Harvest. <span class="tei tei-q">“The parallels affected merely the
          nominal Jewish House <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          House <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          of failure to be in the right condition of heart for the truths
          that were due to them—both rejected for destruction. The Jewish
          System was a Church-State affair, paralleled here by the great
          Church-State systems of Europe, whose destruction began in 1914.
          Let us remember, however, that the three and a half years of Jesus'
          ministry were more a time of preparation of the Apostles to be the
          instruments for the harvesting and a sharpening preparation of the

          beloved, and answered his inquiry so far as was consistent with His
          Plan. Such inquiry should not be regarded as an improper prying
          into the secrets of God. God would have us quickly discern the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chronology
          as it appears in the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES is accurate. The
          year 1914 brought the end of the Times of the Gentiles, but not the
          end of the Harvest work. Have the teachings of the Parallels lost
          their value? Not at all. The point not previously noticed is that
          the Jewish polity was not to be destroyed in Jerusalem only, but
          throughout all Judea. Nor does <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judea</span></span>
          mean all of Palestine. The actual depopulation of the whole of
          Palestine did not occur until the year 135 A. D. (corresponding to
          our year 1980), on the ninth day of the month of Ab, the
          anniversary of the burning of the Temple under Titus. On that day
          came to an end the insurrection of Bar-Cocheba, the false Messiah,
          who wrought his own destruction and that of 580,000 of his
          followers, when he attempted to regain control of Judea and
          Jerusalem. The struggle was of five years' duration having begun in
          130 A. D. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was the effort, under the
          leadership of Bar-Cocheba, to regain their independence, that
          brought about a repetition of scenes enacted under Titus, and
          resulted actually in the depopulation of Palestine. The whole of
          Judea was turned into a desert; about 985 towns and villages were
          laid in ashes; fifty of their fortresses were razed to the ground;
          even the name of their capital was changed to Ælia Capitolina, and
          they were forbidden to approach it on pain of death; thousands of
          those who had escaped death were reduced to slavery, and such as
          could not be thus disposed of were transported into
          Egypt.”</span>—McC.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the Lord
          gave His wonderful prophecy in which the destinies of nominal
          Fleshly Israel, nominal Spiritual Israel, and the Israel of God,
          are set forth, it was in answer to three definite questions:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">When</span></em> shall these things be? and
          what shall be the sign of Thy Parousia, and of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of
          the Age?”</span> (Matt. 24:3.) The Lord did not ignore their
          question. He answered it with a reply that sweeps the history of
          twenty centuries. He showed that the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of
          Fleshly Israel foreshadowed the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end</span></em> of
          Spiritual Israel. Fleshly Israel had three ends; the destruction of
          Jerusalem in A. D. 70, the complete subjugation of Judea in A. D.
          73, and the actual depopulation of the whole of Palestine in A. D.
          135. Which did He mean should be the end that would be a guide to
          His followers? Not the end in A. D. 70, foreshadowing 1915; for the
          Harvest of the Gospel Age is still in progress. Not the end in A.
          D. 135, foreshadowing 1980; for the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Harvest is the
          end</span></span>. He must have meant the end in Judea, even as He
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Then let them which be in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Judea</span></span> flee into the
          mountains.”</span> (Matt. 24:16.) See also Matt. 2:22; 3:5;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name=

          that the conquest of Judea was not completed until the day of the
          Passover, A. D. 73, and in the light of the foregoing Scriptures,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">prove</span></em> that the Spring of 1918 will
          bring upon Christendom a spasm of anguish greater even than that
          experienced in the Fall of 1914. Reexamine the table of the
          Parallel Dispensations in STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, Vol. 2, pages
          246 and 247; change the 37 to 40, 70 to 73 and 1914 to 1918, and we
          believe it is correct and will be fulfilled <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“with great power and glory,”</span> (Mark 13:26.) It
          was entirely impossible to foresee whether our Lord meant that A.
          D. 70 or A. D. 73 should serve as our guide to the time when the
          Jewish polity came to an end, until after October, 1915, had
          passed. Moreover, we have seen the promised signs, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity;
          men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
          things which are coming on the earth,”</span> and we have the
          Lord's words for it that having seen those things <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“even at the doors,”</span> and our
          <span class="tei tei-q">“redemption draweth nigh.”</span> (Luke
          21:25-36; Mark 13:27-30.) It is possible that A. D. 1980 marks the
          regathering of all of Fleshly Israel from their captivity in death.
          It is just 70 years beyond 1910, the date when Pastor Russell gave
          his great witness to the Jewish people in the New York Hippodrome.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the time
          of nominal Zion's travail (Isa. 66:8) is due to occur in the Spring
          of 1918, and if we are now but the <span class="tei tei-q">“one
          day”</span> (one year) distant from that event which the Prophet
          mentions, what should be our expectation regarding the experience
          of the <span class="tei tei-q">“little flock”</span> meantime?
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The symbolic travail, in the above
          prophecy, is a reference to the great Time of Trouble—the travail
          that is to come upon the nominal Gospel church, Great <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Babylon,’</span> from which some are to be counted
          worthy to escape. (Luke 21:36.) This is indicated by the preceding
          verse, which locates the time of this prophecy as synchronous with
          that wherein is heard <span class="tei tei-q">‘a voice of noise
          [confusion] from the city’</span> [Babylon], and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘a voice [of truth and warning] from the Temple’</span>
          [the elect Little Flock of consecrated and faithful ones], and
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘a voice of Jehovah that rendereth
          recompense to His enemies’</span>—in the great Time of Trouble. The
          travail that is coming is to be upon nominal Zion—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Christendom,’</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Babylon’</span>; and it will be a great and sore
          affliction—<span class="tei tei-q">‘a Time of Trouble such as was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But the marvelous thing the Prophet here has to record
          is that a Man-child is to be born out of Zion before this travail
          comes. This is a striking reference to the fact, elsewhere clearly
          taught, that the ripe wheat of the Gospel Church is to be separated
          from the tares, that they are to be exalted and glorified before
          the burning, the consuming trouble, shall come upon the latter.
          This Man-child is, therefore, the Little Flock—the true Zion in
          God's estimation, the Body of Christ; as it is written.
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘There shall come out of Zion [the nominal
          Gospel Church] the Deliverer [The Christ, Head and Body], and shall
          turn away ungodliness from Jacob [the Fleshly Israel, or
          Zion].’</span> (Rom. 11:26.) This is the Man-child that is to bless
          all the families of the earth. (Gen. 28:14; Gal. 3:16, 29.) The
          birth of the Man-child is the First Resurrection. Blessed and holy
          are all they that have part in the First Resurrection. Such are now
          begotten of God by the Word of Truth, and quickened by the Holy
          Spirit (Jas. 1:18; Eph. 2:1; Rom. 8:11), and in due time—before the
          travail—they will be born in the glorious likeness of Christ. The
          birth of this Man-child began over eighteen hundred years ago with
          the resurrection of Christ Jesus. There the Head of this Body of
          Christ came forth; and as surely as the Head has been born, so
          surely shall the Body come forth. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shall I
          bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord:
          shall I cause to bring forth and shut the womb? saith thy
          God.’</span> (Isa. 66:9.) Ah, no! <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          Man-child, The Christ complete, the Great Deliverer, shall come
          forth.’</span> ”</span>—Z. '94-135.</p>

          (John 10:4.) The separation between the Elijah and Elisha classes
          will be brought about in a perfectly natural way, by some using the
          chariot which the Lord provides, and others recognizing it, but not
          attempting to use it to mount to the skies. And what should we
          expect such a fiery chariot would do when caught up into the
          heavens? The answer is prophetic, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          heavens being on fire shall be dissolved;”</span> <span class=

          10; Isa. 34:4.) Evidently the circulation of the penny will have
          something to do with the burning of the tares!—Matt. 13:40-43; Isa.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Forty days after
          Christ's resurrection His ascension occurred. This confirms the
          hope of the Church's glorification forty years (a year for a day)
          after the awakening of the sleeping saints in the Spring of 1878.
          The seven days before the Deluge may represent seven years, from
          1914 to 1921, in the midst of which <span class="tei tei-q">“week
          of years”</span> the last members of the Messiah pass beyond the
          veil. The Great Company class shall be cut off at its end—the fact
          that we see the first half of this week so distinctly marked would
          lead us to expect three and one-half years more of witnessing by
          the Great Company class; for it seems to be the Heavenly Father's
          way to accomplish His work by weeks and half weeks, from the very
          beginning of creation until now. The covenant with Abraham, 2045 B.
          C., was half way (2081 years each way) between the fall of Adam,
          4127 B. C., and the conversion of Cornelius, A. D. 36. The last
          observance of a typical jubilee by Israel, 626 B. C., was half way
          (2500 years each way) from the end of Adam's Day, 3127 B. C., and
          the beginning of the Times of Restitution, A. D. 1874. The
          captivity, 606 B. C., marks the beginning of the Times of the
          Gentiles, half way (2520 years each way) between the end of Adam's
          1000-year day, 3127 B. C., and the end of Gentile Times, A. D.
          1914. The captivity, 606 B. C., marks a point half way (3520 years
          each way) between the fall of man, 4127 B. C., and his full
          restoration to Divine favor, A. D. 2914. Christ's death, A. D. 33,
          marks a point half way (1845 years each way) between the death of
          Jacob, 1813 B. C., and the restoration of favor to Israel in 1878
          A. D. The death of Christ, A. D. 33, was half way (three and
          one-half years each way) between His baptism, A. D. 29, and the
          conversion of Cornelius, A. D. 36.</p>

          Restitution in 1874 and the close of the High Calling in 1881. Our
          proposition is that the glorification of the little Flock in the
          Spring of 1918 A. D. will be half way (three and one-half years
          each way) between the close of the Gentile Times and the close of
          the Heavenly Way, A. D. 1921. The three days' (three
          years—1918-1921) fruitless search for Elijah (2 Kings 2:17-18) is a
          confirmation of this view. We shall wait to see; but we shall not

          <span class="tei tei-q">“A precious stone, variegated with divers

          adorable, how sublime, how perfect is our God! How impossible to
          describe Him! To know Him aright will require eternity. The jasper
          seems especially to illustrate His glory, perfection and <em class=

          and the high polish of which it is susceptible, and which it
          retains longer than any other gem. The sardius is the stone now
          called the carnelian, from its color, which resembles that of raw
          flesh. It is supposed to stop hemorrhage when laid on a fresh
          wound.”</span> (McC.) The sardius seems especially to illustrate
          God's love, His memory of His creatures, and His purpose of a

          <span class="tei tei-q">“David is not ascended into the

          they without us should not be made perfect.”</span> (Heb. 11:40.)
          But from the time that <span class="tei tei-q">“holy men of God
          spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit”</span> (2 Pet. 1:21),
          the utterances of Enoch, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, Job, David, Solomon,

          Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah,

          of all the truth which Thou hast shewed unto Thy servant.”</span>
          (Gen. 32:10.) Moses said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who am I that I
          should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children
          of Israel out of Egypt?”</span> (Exod. 3:11.) David said,

          house, that Thou hast brought me hitherto?”</span> (2 Sam. 7:18.)
          Solomon said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am but a little child: I
          know not how to go out or come in.”</span> (1 Kings 3:7.) Isaiah
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe is me! for I am undone; because
          I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of
          unclean lips.”</span> (Isa. 6:5.) Jeremiah said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, Lord God! behold I cannot speak: for I am a
          child.”</span> (Jer. 1:6.) Daniel said, <span class=

          I have.”</span> (Dan. 2:30.) And John the Baptist said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have need to be baptised of Thee, and
          comest Thou to me?”</span> (Matt. 3:14.) But the Lord knoweth them

          was the first of the holy Prophets; and according to the Apostle
          Jude he prophesied of the coming reign of Christ and His glorious
          Bride, to judge the world, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Lord cometh with a myriad of His saints, to execute
          judgment.”</span> (Jude 14, 15.) That there shall be such a
          glorious and blessed Judgment Day, full of hope and joy for all the
          world, the Apostle Paul says is definitely decreed in the counsels
          of God, <span class="tei tei-q">“whereof He hath given
          assurance,”</span> grounds for confident, joyful anticipation,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“unto all men.”</span> (Acts 17:31.) When
          that happy time comes, <span class="tei tei-q">“the inhabitants of
          the world will learn righteousness”</span> (Isa. 26:9), and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the poor of the people will be lifted
          up”</span> (Psa. 72:2-4, 12-14.) It will be the long-promised poor
          man's chance.</p>

          was one of the holy Prophets; and in Gen. 49:10 he says,

          nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto
          Him shall the gathering of the people be.”</span> The sceptre means
          the right to rule, the title to power; and Shiloh means peacemaker.
          So this prophecy is merely another way of saying that Judah would
          be the ancestor of the great Lawgiver, the great <span class=

          as a historian, recorded God's original purpose to give man
          dominion over the earth (Gen. 1:28); His declaration to the serpent
          that the Seed of the woman should bruise its head (Gen. 3:15); the
          promise to Abraham that in him all the families of the earth shall
          be blessed (Gen. 12:3); that Abraham's inheritance should be an
          earthly one (Gen. 13:15); and an everlasting one (Gen. 17:8); that
          all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him (Gen. 18:18);
          that in his Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
          (Gen. 22:18); to Isaac, that in his Seed shall all the nations of
          the earth be blessed (Gen. 26:4); to Jacob, that in his Seed shall
          all the families of the earth be blessed (Gen. 28:14); to Jacob
          again, that he should be a joint-heir with Abraham and Isaac of the
          land of Canaan (Gen. 35:12); by the sacrifices after the day of
          atonement was typically shown the perfection of mankind in the
          Millennium (Lev. 1:5); by the glory appearing unto all the people
          was foretold their future release from sin and death (Lev. 9:23);
          by the acceptance of a goat as a sin-offering for the people we see
          blessings of life for the world after the Church's career is
          finished (Lev. 16:15); and by the sounding of the jubilee trumpet,
          the proclamation of liberty to the captives and the return of every
          man to his possession, we see the world's restoration to the image
          and likeness of God. (Lev. 25:10.) As a Prophet, his declarations
          show that throughout the Gospel Age God would raise up a great
          Prophet and Deliverer like unto himself (The Christ), to whom shall
          all the people give heed in the Millennial Age (Deut. 18:15, 19);
          and that this great Deliverer then would set before them life, if
          obedient, and death, if disobedient.—Deut. 30:15.</p>

          first places in the Bible where we are shown that what goes into
          hell does not necessarily stay there. Another instance, in which
          Samuel foretold pictorially the coming of the better King, was in
          the case of the coronation of King Saul. Saul had been selected
          king, but had an attack of bashfulness; and when they had searched,
          they found him behind the baggage. The record is, <span class=

          among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his

          God's choice for king; his name means <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“desire of all nations.”</span> This
          incident looks forward to the time when all the people of the world
          will say of Christ, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! who is like unto

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Jonah</span></span> was the next one of the
          holy Prophets; and in the fourth chapter we have an interesting
          picture of events now transpiring before our eyes. Jonah walked
          into the city of Nineveh and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet
          forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”</span> The prophecy
          was fulfilled in forty literal years. But when Jonah saw that
          things were not coming out as he expected, he was very angry and
          said to the Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“That is just what I
          might have expected; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and
          merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; and I said so
          before I left my own country.”</span> Jonah went out, sat in the
          hot sun on the outside of the city, and began to sulk. The Lord
          took pity on him and caused a gourd to grow up over him, to shelter
          him from the hot rays of the sun. And Jonah was exceeding glad
          because of the gourd. Then the Lord prepared a worm to smite the
          gourd; and a strong east wind blew up and the gourd withered.
          Jonah's shade was gone, and he was angrier than ever. The Lord
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Doest thou well to be angry?”</span>
          and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I do well to be angry,
          even unto death.”</span> Then the Lord said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jonah, thou hast had pity on the gourd that sprung up
          in a night and perished in a night; and should not I spare Nineveh,
          that great city wherein are more than six score thousand
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name=
          "Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persons that cannot
          discern between their right hand and their left hand?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We live in a day
          when a class have been preaching that the world is to be destroyed;
          and, like Jonah, they have not properly understood their message.
          The kind of world that is to be destroyed is Satan's world, Satan's
          empire, arrangement, or order of things—not our literal earth. The
          word world does not always refer to our literal earth. For
          instance, when the Apostle James says, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          tongue is a world of iniquity,”</span> he does not mean that we
          have inside our jaws a little planet that turns over every
          twenty-four hours, that has spring, summer, fall, winter,
          snowstorms, rainstorms, and a moon revolving about it, with once in
          a while a comet and a shower of meteors thrown in for good measure.
          When they think about the Panama Canal, and the wonderful works of
          irrigation which are causing the desert to rejoice and blossom as
          the rose, and all the other wonderful achievements of our day,
          these people are beginning to see that they have made a mistake and
          are now about where Jonah was when he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That is what I might have expected, for I know that
          Thou art a just God, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.”</span>
          They are now outside the city, and the scorching light of Present
          Truth is pretty hot. Meantime the church trust is growing up to
          keep off the heat. We are not to have anything to do with this
          church federation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Say ye not, A
          confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A
          confederacy.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Take counsel
          together, and it shall come to naught; speak the word and it shall
          not stand; for God is with us.”</span> (Isa. 8:10, 12.) Pretty soon
          something will happen to the church trust, and their shade will be
          gone. Then the Lord will say to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
          you need not feel so badly! You are not the first people that ever
          made a mistake. You have made lots of them, to be sure. You have
          had pity on the church trust which grew up in one year and blew up
          in another year; and should not I spare the poor world, that as far
          as their knowledge of right and wrong is concerned do not know the
          difference between their right hand and their left
          hand?”</span></p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nahum</span></span> was the next one of the
          holy Prophets; and after prophesying in the last verse of the
          preceding chapter about the coming of the King with His good
          tidings of peace to the sin-burdened earth, he next tells (Nahum
          2:3-6) of an interesting thing that will be a matter of common
          everyday experience at the time the Kingdom is established. He
          describes a railway train in motion [not an automobile, as some
          think], and if we will be at the trouble to put ourselves in the
          Prophet's place we can see just what he saw in his vision and what
          he has so interestingly described. First, the Prophet stands
          looking at the engine coming toward him, and then says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The shield [the thing ahead of this great
          warrior—the headlight] is made red [shines brilliantly], the
          valiant men [the engineer and the fireman] are dyed scarlet [when
          the flames from the firebox illuminate the interior of the cab at
          night, as the fireman opens the firedoor to throw in the coal]. The
          chariots [the railway coaches] shall be with [shall be preceded by
          locomotives that, at night, have the appearance of] flaming
          torches, in the Day of Preparation.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next the Prophet
          takes his place in the train and looks out of the window, and,
          seemingly, <span class="tei tei-q">“The fir trees shall be terribly
          shaken [the telegraph poles alongside the track seem to be fairly
          dancing]. The chariots shall rage in the streets [a railway is
          merely an elaborate, scientifically constructed street, or
          highway], they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways
          [the clanking and bumping of the cars together is one of the
          significant items of railway travel]. They shall seem like torches
          [a railway train at night, rushing through a distant field, looks
          like nothing so much as a vast torch, going at flying speed], they
          shall run like the lightnings.”</span> Next the Prophet sees the
          conductor coming for his ticket and says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He shall recount his worthies [the conductor spends
          his entire time, almost, counting and recounting his passengers,
          keeping them checked up, etc.]; they shall stumble in their walk
          [try walking on a rapidly moving train]; they shall make haste to
          the wall thereof [to the next city or town] and the coverer [the
          train shed, the station] shall be prepared [the baggageman,
          expressman, mail wagon, hotel bus, intending passengers, and
          friends to meet incoming passengers, will all be there waiting for
          the train to come]. The gates of the rivers shall be opened [the
          doors of the cars will be opened and the people will flow out] and
          the palace [car] shall be dissolved
          [emptied].”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg

          happening now, and all that will occur throughout the Millennial
          Age, down to its very close—down to the time when every creature in
          Heaven and in earth and those in the sea, shall ascribe praise,

          The manner of the writing, some of it from left to right and some
          from right to left, enables the fulfilments to follow the
          prophecies exactly, item by item, to the last jot and tittle. Write
          a word on a sheet of paper and then turn the paper over and look at
          it, holding it in front of a good light. Thus it is with the Word
          of God. The prophecies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg

          look strange until the due time has come for holding them up to the
          light, and then they become clear. What could be only imperfectly
          deciphered until the hindering seal is broken is no mystery after
          the seal is broken, because the book or scroll or chart can be
          turned about and held to the light. The fulfilments are seen to fit
          the prophecies. If the lines are not clear, then for some reason we
          are looking upon that much of the record from the outside and not
          from the inside.</p>

          portion of a public service. No one supposes that it was the work
          of Athanasius. [Athanasius originated the monastery-convent system.
          He was the Bishop of Alexandria and friend of the Emperor
          Constantine who caused the banishment of Arius.] No one is now, at
          least among us, in any danger from the errors it denounces; for no
          one believes that all the members of the Greek Church are
          necessarily consigned to everlasting damnation; and thus, every
          time the creed is read, the officiating minister has solemnly to
          enunciate what neither he nor any of his hearers believes. It is
          true that by distinguishing between the creed itself and the
          damnatory clauses he may save himself, mentally, from declaring a
          falsehood; but surely this is reason enough for the removal of the
          creed from our Liturgy. We have had too much in our Church of
          mental reservations. So far as the doctrine of the Trinity is
          concerned, it is abundantly insisted on in the Apostles' and Nicene

          necessary that he hold the Catholic faith, which faith, except
          every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall
          perish everlastingly. And the Catholic faith is this: that we
          worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither
          confounding the persons nor dividing the substance. For there is
          one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the
          Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son and of the
          Holy Ghost is all one; the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal.
          Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Ghost.
          The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the Holy Ghost uncreate.
          The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy
          Ghost incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and
          the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals, but
          one eternal. As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor
          three uncreated, but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible. So
          likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy
          Ghost almighty. And yet there are not three almighties, but one
          almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Ghost
          is God. And yet there are not three Gods, but one God. So likewise
          the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord and the Holy Ghost Lord. And
          yet not three Lords, but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by
          the Christian verity to acknowledge every person by Himself to be
          God and Lord, so are we forbidden by the Catholic religion to say
          there be three Gods and three Lords. The Father is made of none,
          neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not
          made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father
          and the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but
          proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not
          three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this
          Trinity none is afore or after other; none is greater or less than
          another. But the whole three persons are co-eternal together, and
          co-equal. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity
          and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</span></span></p>

            rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right

            the Son of God, is God and man. God of the substance of the
            Father, begotten before the worlds; and man of the substance of
            His mother, born in the world. Perfect God and perfect man, or a
            reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father
            as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the Father as touching
            His manhood. Who, although He be God and man, yet He is not two,
            but one Christ. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh,
            but by taking of the manhood into God. One altogether, not by
            confusion of substance, but by unity of person. For as the
            reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one
            Christ. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose
            again the third day from the dead. He ascended into Heaven; He
            sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty. From
            whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. At whose
            coming all men shall rise again in their bodies, and shall
            account for their own works. And they that have done good shall
            go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into
            everlasting fire. This is the Catholic faith which, except a man
            believe faithfully he cannot be saved. Glory be to the Father,
            and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the
            beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.

            of the eucharist there is truly, really and substantially the
            body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord

          His Son to save mankind (1 John 4:10); that the Logos was made

          poor (2 Cor. 8:9), lower than the angels (Heb. 2:9), a servant
          (Phil. 2:7), a man (Phil. 2:8); that while a man He did not have
          all wisdom (Luke 2:52) but admitted the Father's greater power
          (John 14:28) and knowledge (Matt. 24:36); that as the Father had
          previously said that He would give His own personal glory to no one
          (Isa. 42:8), so Jesus admitted He and the Father were two separate
          persons (John 8:17, 18); that He admitted He had not the glory of
          the Father (John 17:5) and expected the same unity between the
          Church and the Father as existed between Himself and the Father
          (John 17:21-23); that when He died He was really, truly, completely
          dead, as dead as though He had never previously existed (1 Cor.
          15:3; Rev. 1:18); that God raised Him from the dead (Acts 2:24;
          Gal. 1:1); highly exalted Him (Phil. 2:9) to Divine nature (2 Pet.
          1:4); making Him the express image of Himself (Heb. 1:3); but that
          even since His resurrection our Father is still Jesus' Father and
          our God is still His God (John 20:17); that a thousand years hence
          Jesus will still be subject to the Father (1 Cor. 15:28); that to
          us there is but one God (1 Cor. 8:6) and that every doctrine that
          confesseth that Jesus Christ when He came in the flesh came as
          anything more or less than a fleshly being is the spirit of

          come out of hell, learn of God, forget Him and are returned there?
          We may all know (Jude 11) that Korah, or Core, went to hell; but
          how many of us know that he was accompanied to this place by his
          house, with all his household goods, and two other establishments
          similarly equipped? (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Num.</span></span> 16:32, 33.) We may all know
          that the Sodomites went to hell (Gen. 19), but how many know that
          they were accompanied by the city in which they lived and that
          there are other cities there? (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matt.</span></span>
          11:23.) We may all suppose that many heathen warriors of long ago
          went to hell, but how many of us know that they took with them
          their weapons of war, and that their swords are there now, under
          their heads, with what is left of their bones? (Ezek. 32:27.) We
          may understand that the wealthy go to hell, but how many know that
          in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg
          116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          same place are sheep, gray hairs, worms, dust, trees and
          water?—Psa. 49:14; Gen. 44:31; Job 17:13-16; Ezek. 31:16.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may all know
          that bad men go to hell, but how many of us know that the Ancient
          Worthies, Jacob and Hezekiah, fully expected to go there, and that
          faithful Job prayed to go there? (Gen. 37:35; Job 14:13.) We may
          all wish to keep out of hell, but how many of us know that David
          said there is not a man that liveth that shall deliver his soul
          from its power, and that Solomon says, thou goest there, whosoever
          thou art? (Psa. 89:48; Eccl. 9:10.) We may think that those who go
          to hell go there to stay forever, but how many of us know that
          Samuel said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord killeth and maketh
          alive; He bringeth down to hell and bringeth up”</span> out of
          hell, and that David said, God has the same power to aid those in
          hell that He has to bless those in Heaven? (1 Sam. 2:6; Psa.
          139:8.) We may think that those who go into hell never come out,
          and that there is no record that any have come out, yet there are
          at least two persons in history who have been in hell and come out
          of hell. One is Jonah, who prayed in hell and was delivered from
          hell (Jonah 2:2), and the other is Christ, whose soul went to hell,
          but <span class="tei tei-q">“His soul was not left in hell,”</span>
          for God raised Him up out of it. (Acts 2:31.) And when Christ came
          out of hell He brought with Him <span class="tei tei-q">“The keys
          of hell”</span> and now has the power and the right to set all its
          captives free. (Rev. 1:18.) We may suppose that hell is to last
          forever, but the Prophet speaks of its coming destruction, and John
          the Revelator says that it is to be made to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“deliver up the dead”</span> which are in it, and it,
          itself, is to be destroyed. (Hosea 13:14; Rev. 20:13.) The last
          passage cited affords the explanation of the whole subject, for in
          the margin opposite Rev. 20:13 the translators have explained that
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“hell”</span> means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“grave.”</span> Reversely, in the margin opposite 1
          Cor. 15:55, the translators have explained that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“grave”</span> means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hell.”</span> The terms are interchangeable and the
          meaning is the same. In every place foregoing in which the
          citations appear in italic type, the translators have rendered
          Sheol or Hades by <span class="tei tei-q">“grave”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pit”</span> instead of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“hell.”</span> In the margins of the old family Bibles,
          printed before Pastor Russell was born, we are told in seven
          places, and in both ways, in both the Old Testament and the New,
          that hell means the grave, and the grave means hell.—Psa. 49:15;
          55:15; 86:13; Isa. 14:9; Jonah 2:2; 1 Cor. 15:55; Rev. 20:13.</p>

          Besides the common forms of persecution and death, such as racking,
          burning, drowning, stabbing, starving and shooting with arrows and
          guns, fiendish hearts meditated how the most delicate and sensitive
          parts of the body, capable of the most excruciating pain, could be
          affected; molten lead was poured into the ears; tongues were cut
          out and lead poured into the mouths; wheels were arranged with
          knife blades attached so that the victim could be slowly chopped to
          pieces; claws and pincers were made red hot and used upon sensitive
          parts of the body; eyes were gouged out; finger nails were pulled
          off with red hot irons; holes, by which the victim was tied up,
          were bored through the heels; some were forced to jump from
          eminences onto long spikes fixed below, where, quivering with pain,
          they slowly died. The mouths of some were filled with gunpowder,
          which, when fired, blew their heads to pieces; others were hammered
          to pieces on anvils; others, attached to bellows, had air pumped
          into them until they burst; others were choked to death with
          mangled pieces of their own bodies; others with urine, excrement,
          etc., etc.”</span>—B. 346.</p>

          winds of the earth referred to here are, of course, symbolic. The
          thought is that the winds from the four quarters—North, East, South
          and West—are being held back, and that when the restraint is
          withdrawn they will rush together, and the result will be a
          whirlwind. Certain Scriptures tell of a whirlwind that will be
          raised up from the coasts of the earth. See Jer. 23:19; 25:32, 33;
          30:23, 24. We do not understand that this will be a physical
          whirlwind, but this symbolic expression is used to convey the
          thought of a severe strife of the powers of the air. These
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘powers of the air,’</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘winds,’</span> are not powers of natural air, but are
          the powers referred to by St. Paul when he speaks of Satan as
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Prince of the power of the
          air,’</span> (Eph. 2:2.) Those spirits who have been under the
          control of Satan—the fallen angels—were to be restrained until the
          Judgment of the Great Day. (Jude 6.) The letting loose of these
          winds, or air powers, would seem to show that God will let go His
          hand of restraint; that He will have to do with the permission of
          the terrible trouble that will come. This outside influence will
          exercise a baneful effect upon men, when finally granted the
          liberty. These fallen spirits have been under restraint for these
          many centuries, but they have exercised their influence to whatever
          extent they have had permission. If they had had unlimited power
          they would have wrecked the world long ago; but they have been
          restrained. Apparently God will soon cease to restrain the fallen
          angels, and they will then proceed to vent their fury upon
          humanity, so that the whole earth will be full of violence, the
          same as in the days of Noah. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          trial of all the fallen angels—the lifting of the restraints to see
          whether they will go contrary to the Divine will. All who thus
          manifest their alliance with evil in any way will become subjects
          of the Second Death; while others who show their loyalty to God
          will mark themselves as worthy, presumably, of everlasting life.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It may be

          letting loose suddenly of the fallen angels will account well for
          the suddenness of the coming trouble, which everywhere in the

          opportunity to show, if they wish, that they are sick of sin and
          desire to return to harmony with God. We cannot think that God will
          allow this trial of the angels during the Millennial Reign, for
          then, nothing shall hurt; nothing shall destroy; Satan will be

          have certain liberties granted, to prove them. Otherwise, where

          Beautiful voice of the Lord: strong, humble, wise, loving, gentle,
          just, merciful, faithful, self-sacrificing; one of the noblest,
          grandest characters of all history <span class="tei tei-q">“I lift
          my pen, not in defense of any doctrine, creed or dogma, but in
          defense of a man, in defense of fairness, justice and
          righteousness. Pastor C. T. Russell, of Brooklyn, N. Y., stands out
          prominently as a target for the pulpits and religious press of the
          country today. I believe there is no one more bitterly persecuted,
          harshly condemned, woefully misrepresented and misunderstood than
          this fearless, conscientious man of God. No infidel writer, such as
          Hume, Voltaire or Ingersoll, ever suffered such ruthless attacks as
          have been made upon Mr. Russell. Whether this persecution and
          misrepresentation is due to prejudice or ignorance of this man's
          real character and writing, is not for me to say, but I believe
          both are elements that play a part in the widespread criticism
          uttered both from the pulpit and the press. Naturally, men will
          resent any attack made upon the creed of their persuasion, for they
          hold to their religious creed and affiliations with more tenacity
          than they realize, until some strong mind, backed by Scripture
          proof, begins to uproot their doctrine by showing their
          inconsistencies and errors. This is what Mr. Russell proceeds to
          do. As a logician and theologian he is doubtless without a peer
          today. In his research for Biblical Truth and harmony he is without
          a parallel in this Age. Without a blemish in his character, with
          the loftiest ideals of God, and the possibilities of man, he towers
          like a giant, unmatched. His defects fade into insignificance. He
          has been too busy spreading Divine Truth, as he honestly sees it,
          to waste time in frivolous speculation in matters not in some way
          connected with man's future state, as outlined in <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘The Plan of the Ages.’</span> Unselfish, liberal and
          courteous to Christians of all denominations, but fearlessly
          condemning, in unmeasured terms, the errors and inconsistencies in
          their creeds, as he sees them, he ranks with immortal benefactors,
          and is stamping his opinion on the world as no other man has

          of the Reformation. Efforts to throttle the press to prevent the
          publication of his sermons have repeatedly been made. Why this
          opposition? Why would any one oppose investigation or revelation
          and searching the Scriptures? Why? What right has any one to
          prevent free thought, free speech, or the freedom of the press?
          What manner of men are we? Let men, preachers or what not, beware
          of blocking the way of such a man. Jesus said, <span class=

          be like Gamaliel in the days of the Apostles, when St. Peter and
          others were on trial. Gamaliel rose up and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Refrain from these men, and let them alone, for if

          unworthy of life on any plane. This is something with which some
          but not many are yet familiar. Truly, we know the Apostle in
          writing of this evil day says, <span class="tei tei-q">“We wrestle
          not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
          powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
          spiritual wicked ones in heavenly places”</span> (Eph. 6:12).
          Truly, we know the Lord Jesus, at the First Advent began His
          ministry with forty days of conflict with the Adversary, who all
          that time sought to sway His mind (Matt. 4:1-11). Truly, we have
          reason to believe He must have had other terrible battles when He
          spent all night in prayer, and especially when He was so depressed
          in the garden of Gethsemane. But without actual experience it is
          quite impossible to conceive of the intensity of such struggles as
          Eph. 6:12 suggests. The base of the brain is seized as in a vise.
          Interpretations of Scripture, ingenious, but misleading beyond
          description, are projected into the mind as water might be
          projected through a hose. Visions may be tried, wonderful
          illuminations of the mind as by a soft but glorious greenish or
          yellowish haze. Seductive suggestions may be made, based on
          circumstances of the environment. Offers of inspiration may be
          made. The privilege of sleep may be taken away for days at a
          stretch. All this is with the object of forcing the unfortunate
          into at least temporary insanity so as to destroy his influence
          and, if possible, his faith in God. Failing in all other attempts,
          the mind may be flooded with thoughts that are vile beyond
          description. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that
          Jehovah intends some unique experiences for the antitypical Isaac
          may be judged from the fact that between Isaac's conception (Gen.
          17:19 and 18:10) and his birth (Gen. 21:1) occurred the destruction
          of Sodom (Gen. 18:16 to end of 19th Chap.) and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abraham's denial of
          Sarah</span></span> (Gen. 20). But reading the latter account, the
          child of God is comforted with God's care of His little ones (Gen.
          20:3) with the assurance that none of Satan's plans can mature
          (Gen. 20:18) without the Lord's permission. Isaac was a type of the
          complete Christ; and if now The Christ is complete, as we believe,
          and ready to be born into the Kingdom, we should not be surprised
          at anything that might look like our repudiation at the Father's
          hands. If He pours the cup, it will only be because He knows that
          we can drink it, and because He wishes to prove to angels and to
          men that we are worthy of the honors He is to give us.—Lu. 22:42,

          diligent student of time prophecy (Luke 12:39); but not having the
          Holy Spirit he is unable to reach accurate conclusions. Seeing a
          definite Plan, and a definite time for every important feature of
          that Plan, his aim has ever been to thwart the purposes of the
          Almighty. This attempt to destroy the Seed began with the death of
          Abel and still continues. No doubt Satan <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">believed</span></em> the Millennial Kingdom
          was due to be set up in 1915; and no doubt, also, he knew that
          seven years prior to the time of the setting up of that kingdom the
          restraints upon the evil spirits would be lifted. Be that as it
          may, there is evidence that the establishment of the Kingdom in
          Palestine will probably be in 1925, ten years later than we once
          calculated. The 70 jubilees, reckoned as 50 years each, expire
          October, 1925. (B. 186.) Gen. 15:1-16:3, read connectedly,
          indicates that Abraham's vision as to when he would receive the
          Kingdom was not granted until ten years after the Covenant was
          made, or 2035 B. C. The ages of the animals offered aggregated
          eleven years, which, applied prophetically, on the scale of a year
          for a day, equal 3960 years, the length of time from the date of
          the visions to A. D. 1925 (Z. '07-79). It seems conclusive that the
          hour of Nominal Zion's travail is fixed for the Passover of 1918.
          (See Rev. 3:14.) That will be 7 years prior to 1925. At that time
          there is every reason to believe the fallen angels will invade the
          minds of many of the Nominal Church people, driving them to
          exceedingly unwise conduct and leading to their destruction at the
          hands of the enraged masses, who will later be dragged to the same
          fate. The great war now raging is most certainly the work of evil
          spirits, and the Kaiser is not the only clever ruler who has been
          deceived by evil spirits, as history will sometime show.—Lu.
          12:56.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If our reasoning
          is correct, we inquire whether there was any indication of a move
          on Satan's part 7 years prior to 1915, showing that he expected the
          restraints to be removed from the evil spirits at that time; and we
          answer that there was something very definite indicated at that
          time. In the Vow, advised by Pastor Russell in that year, and in
          the experiences of many, for and against it, it is plain that the
          Enemy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">then</span></em> attempted to come in like a
          flood, but was held back—restrained until the sealing work is done.
          (Matt. 10:25; Luke 22:42-44; Heb. 12:4; Isa. 63:3.) After the
          demons have been turned loose on the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">swine</span></em>
          class, we shall see what happens. (Matt. 7:6; 8:31-34.) Those now
          fearful that they might learn something will be terror-stricken
          then for a different reason.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          an intellectual appreciation which will not only comfort them, and
          shield them, but also be a mark, seal or evidence of their sonship,
          as indicated by our Lord when He promised that the Holy Spirit
          should show to the faithful <span class="tei tei-q">‘things to

          comes, those who have the mark of sonship (Ezek. 9:2-4) will know
          it and will stand the test, while all others will surely fail. A
          letter from one of the Bethel workers, written shortly after Pastor
          Russell's death, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“About three months
          ago I asked several questions at the table, the last one being as
          follows, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Since I now see that the Jewish
          Time of Trouble did not end until the year 73 A. D., as I fully
          proved to myself by consulting the historians, what then are we to
          expect in the parallel year 1918?’</span> Brother Russell put the
          question to three prominent brethren, all of whom replied that they
          did not know, but were willing to wait and see. When he called upon
          me I said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Since the year 73 A. D. saw the
          complete overthrow of nominal Natural Israel in Palestine, so in
          the parallel year 1918, I infer we should look for the complete
          overthrow of nominal Spiritual Israel; i. e., the fall of Babylon.
          (Rev. 18.)’</span> Brother Russell replied: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Exactly. That is exactly the inference to

          there is a Divine order in the arrangement of the names, inasmuch
          as that order is different from the order of the birth of Jacob's

          very few characters named in the Bible about whom nothing
          uncomplimentary is expressed. He well represents all the other
          members of the Divine family, all of whom have attained the Divine
          likeness in their hearts and given expression to that likeness as
          well as the frailties and weaknesses of the flesh would permit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          noticed that the tribes of Dan and Ephraim are omitted from the
          foregoing list. Dan evidently represents the class that goes into
          the Second Death. The name signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“God
          hath judged me.”</span> (Gen. 30:6.) We know that all God's
          judgments are just and look for the reason for Dan's rejection.
          Jacob prophesied that it would be Dan <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall
          backward.”</span> (Gen. 49:17.) Horses are symbols of doctrines.
          Dan evidently represents a class tampering with doctrines,
          resulting in the overthrow of the New Creature. A study of the
          history of the tribe of Dan confirms this. Originally Dan was given
          one of the choicest parts of Palestine, one of the most fertile and
          the most secure. It was completely embraced by its two brother
          tribes Ephraim and Benjamin, while on the south-east and south it
          joined Judah, and was thus surrounded by the three most powerful
          states of the whole confederacy. The Danites however failed to
          conquer the land originally assigned to them (representing the
          failure of the New Creature to gain the victory over the mind of
          the flesh) and chose another inheritance to the far north (Judges
          18:1-31). This selection of the farthest north resembles Satan's
          similar choice (Isa. 14:13) and suggests that the Danite New
          Creatures were led away from their original inheritance by
          ambition. The context shows an unreasonably high valuation of their
          own judgment and a wilful interference with the priestly office,
          and this we may judge has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          been a frequent offense of those who commit the great sin that lies
          just beyond the sin of presumption. (Psa. 19:13; 2 Sam. 6:6, 7.)
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">THE TEST

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The half tribe
          of Ephraim represents the Great Company, mainly to be found in the
          Nominal Church. They are more or less intoxicated with error (Isa.
          28:1, 7), they fear to let go of their idols of creeds and
          catechisms (Hos. 4:17), they are, in a way, half-baked Christians,
          not wholly devoted to the Lord—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ephraim is
          a cake not turned.”</span> (Hos. 7:8.) From first to last the
          prophecy of Hosea is eloquent with Jehovah's pleadings to the Great
          Company class not to miss the great prize of Immortality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7:9.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-family: sans-serif">After this, I beheld, and lo, a great
          multitude.</span></span>—When the Apostle tells us in 2 John 8,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Look to yourselves that ye lose not those
          things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full
          reward,”</span> he is teaching that a Heavenly reward may be gained
          that is not as full as if a course more pleasing to the Heavenly
          Father is pursued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of
          teaching that the saved of our race will all be saved to the same
          thing, the Scriptures show two degrees or kinds of Heavenly
          salvation, and two degrees or kinds of earthly salvation. In the
          second chapter of Genesis the stream which went forth from the
          Garden of Eden was divided into four parts. This is a Scriptural
          recognition of the fact that from Adam, the original fountain of
          life, will flow four streams: The Little Flock, who are to sit down
          with Christ in His Throne; the Great Company, who are to stand
          before the Throne, having the palms of martyrdom but without the
          crowns of glory; the Ancient Worthies, the Jewish fathers, Abraham,
          Isaac, Jacob, Daniel, etc., who are to be made princes in all the
          earth; and the world of mankind, who will constitute the subjects
          of the Kingdom over which the Ancient Worthies will rule. The same
          lesson is taught in the division of the Levites into four camps,
          each located on a different side of the Tabernacle. (Num. 3:15; F.
          128, 129.) It is also taught in the Apostle's statement in 2 Tim.
          2:20, that in God's great House there will ultimately be found four
          classes of vessels to His praise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question for
          the saints is not as to which of the earthly classes may ultimately
          include them, for they have given up their earthly hopes in
          exchange for Heavenly hopes. The question is whether they shall be
          wise virgins, faithful students of the Word, building with the
          gold, silver and precious stones of Divine Truth instead of foolish
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">virgins</span></em> (pure of heart) (Matt.
          25:2; C. 91; F. 75) who build faith structures with the wood, hay
          and stubble of human tradition. The Apostle says the fiery trials
          of life will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
          135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          try every man's work so as by fire, and intimates that those who do
          not build wisely shall suffer loss—not go into eternal torment, but
          fail to gain the great reward which otherwise might be theirs. (1
          Cor. 3:15; T. 69.) The question is whether as branches in Christ
          the Vine, to go onward to fruit-bearing, or as other branches, to
          be principally devoted to leaves (professions), or tendrils
          (feelers after earthly honors and emoluments). (John 15:2; F. 78,
          170.) Christ said of a similar class in His day, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How can ye believe [effectively] which receive honor
          one of another, and seek not the praise which cometh from God
          only!”</span> The question is whether we are to be termed children
          of disobedience (Col. 3:6; Z. '99-140) because, though God's
          children, we have failed to mortify, or put to death, our earthly
          and sinful tendencies; whether we are sinners against the covenant
          we have made with God to lay down our lives in His service (Psa.
          1:1; Z. '00-281), whether, like Lot's wife, we look back to the
          earthly good things we have given up (Gen. 19:26; C. 194), or
          whether we retain the singleness of heart and purpose, without
          which the prize of the High Calling cannot be gained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question is
          whether, as babes in Christ, we shall wink at the unscriptural
          divisions of God's people, into followers of Paul or Apollos,
          Cephas or Luther, Calvin or Wesley (1 Cor. 3:4; D. 17); whether,
          like Rahab, we shall be in the citadel of error when it falls, or
          like Joshua who caused it to fall (Josh. 6:25; Z. '07-267);
          whether, like the fitches and cummin, we shall easily divest
          ourselves of the entangling associations of life, represented by
          the pods from which the fitches and cummin are so easily shaken, or
          whether we shall be like the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bread-corn”</span> which requires a vast amount of
          threshing before it will let go of the close-clinging chaff. (Isa.
          28:27; Z. '84-1-4.) The question is whether, like the rejected
          members of Gideon's army, we shall forget our mission, and bury our
          heads in the waters of truth; or whether, with equal appreciation
          of its message, we shall remember why the Lord gave it to us, and
          shall drink of it, with our eyes out over the horizon, seeking to
          serve, to spend and be spent in the Master's service. (Judg. 7:6;
          Z. '07-331.) The question is whether, like Caleb and Joshua, we
          shall retain our confidence in Him who has called us, and bring
          back true reports of the land we hope ere long to possess, or,
          whether we shall be of the larger company that through fear and
          faint-heartedness never enter in. (Num. 13:31; Z. '07-251.) Shall
          we rejoice to lay down our lives for the Lord's brethren, or shall
          we, through fear of this sacrificial death, be all our lifetime
          subject to bondage? (Heb. 2:15; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> T. 70, 71.) The question is whether we shall
          be like the servant who hid his Lord's talent in the earth (in
          earthly enjoyments and pursuits) (Matt. 25:24; Z. '01-61; Z.
          '06-318), whether we shall be double minded, having some idea of
          attaining heavenly things and some idea of getting all we can of
          earthly things (Jas. 1:8; Z. '07-316), whether, like Obadiah, we
          are merely friendly toward the Truth and those who stand for the
          Truth, but conceal our interest for fear of the consequences to
          ourselves and our families.—1 Ki. 18:3; Z. '04-221.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, in these
          tests of faith and character, we come off victorious in the Lord's
          sight, we shall not need to be of those who wash their robes and
          make them white in the blood of the Lamb, in the great tribulation
          with which this Age will close, but shall keep our robes unspotted
          so that they will not need such a general cleansing. If we have
          fled to the Lord before the winter time of His disfavor has come
          upon the man-made systems of our day, we shall be spared the rigors
          of the flight, of which He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray that
          your flight be not in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">the winter</span></em> [of 1917-1918
          (?)]”</span> (Matt. 20:10; D. 578), and we shall be spared, too,
          the bitter disappointment of saying at that time, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Harvest [the time of special favor] is past, the
          summer is ended and we are not saved”</span> [not saved with the
          chiefest salvation, with the salvation to which we aspired]. (Jer.
          8:20; D. 578.) In the time of Zion's travail these children of God
          will all be delivered. (Isa. 66:8; Z. '94-135.) Let us be glad of
          our hope that we shall be of the Man-child delivered before that
          travail comes. Let us hope we may not be of the lambs (Isa. 34:6;
          D. 17) or the goats found together in the nominal sheepfolds when
          the time has come to wind up present ecclesiastical systems. All
          down the Age, some of God's children have been <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“turned over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
          that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord”</span> (1
          Cor. 5:5; T. 69, 71), because they have not lived up to their
          covenants. The sufferings of the scapegoat class, turned into the
          wilderness, dying of thirst, hunger, snake-bites, thorns, briars,
          burrs, fleas or attacks of wild animals, were far greater than
          those of the Lord's goat, killed sacrificially. (Lev. 16:7-10; T.
          60.) Those who withhold from the Lord what they have promised Him
          suffer far more than those who fight manfully the good fight of
          faith and lay hold with both hands on the hope set before us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Great
          Company class will say <span class="tei tei-q">“Alleluia”</span> as
          soon as they perceive that the Church is complete. (Rev. 19:1; A.
          240; F. 128.) But like Rebecca's damsels of old, they must go the
          same long journey as the Bride class, only to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be received as servants in the end.
          (Gen. 24:61; Psa. 45:14; F. 121, 171.) Shall we enter fully into
          our inheritance now, while the door is still open to do and dare in
          the Master's Cause; or shall we be like the class mentioned in
          Ezekiel 44 that finds the door shut because the start is made too
          late, and must know that forever the Heavenly Priesthood, the prize
          of the High Calling, is closed, and that the most that can be then
          attained is the place as keepers or servants in the Temple? (Ezek.
          44:1-14; Z. '05-269.) Let us rejoice if we are heirs of salvation
          at all; but let us resolve, by God's grace, that we shall, in the
          words of our text, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look to ourselves, that
          we lose not those things that we have wrought, but that we receive
          a full reward”</span>—all that the Father is pleased to give to
          those who love Him supremely.</p>

          the Lord's service only what the world considers a reasonable day's
          work, would not be fulfilling our Covenant of Sacrifice at all.
          Those who seek merely to do right, and to put in eight hours or so
          a day faithfully, after the manner of the world, will be judged

          were. Immediately after the flash they come together with an angry

          sized up the Papal system of <span class="tei tei-q">“Heads, I win;

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Romanists have with great dexterity
          built themselves about with three walls, which have hitherto
          protected them against reform. In the first place, when the

          that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them—that on the
          contrary, the spiritual is above the temporal. Secondly, when it is
          proposed to admonish them from the Holy Scriptures they said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘It beseems no one but the pope to
          interpret the Scriptures,’</span> and thirdly, when they were

          and this teaches that Luther did not get entirely free from error.
          The following illustrates this point: <span class=

          convinced that Luther had not the courage of his convictions. They
          proposed to abolish the idolatry of the Mass and all other outward
          signs of what they deemed the old superstitions. Luther's colleague
          at Wittenberg, Carlstadt, began denouncing the monastic life, the
          celibacy of the clergy, the veneration of images; and before the
          end of 1521 we find the first characteristic outward symptoms of
          Protestantism. In January 1522, Carlstadt induced the authorities
          of Wittenberg to publish the first evangelical church ordinance.
          The service of the Mass was modified, and the laity were to receive
          the elements in both kinds. Reminders of the old religious usages
          were to be done away with, and the fast-days were to be no longer
          observed. These measures led Luther to return to Wittenberg in
          March, 1522, where he preached a series of sermons attacking the
          impatience of the radical party. In 1525 the conservative party,
          which had from the first feared that Luther's teaching would result
          in sedition, received a new and terrible proof, as it seemed to
          them, of the noxious influence of the evangelical
          preachers.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The peasant movements which had caused so much anxiety
          at the diet of Augsburg in 1518, culminated in the Peasant Revolt
          in which the common man, both in country and town, rose in the name
          of God's justice to avenge long-standing wrongs and establish his
          rights. Luther was by no means directly responsible for the civil
          war which followed, but he had certainly contributed to stir up the
          ancient discontent. He had asserted that, owing to the habit of
          foreclosing small mortgages, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Any one with
          a hundred gulden could gobble up a peasant a year.’</span> The
          German feudal lords he pronounced hangmen, who knew only how to
          swindle the poor man. Yet in spite of this harsh talk about
          princes, Luther relied upon them to forward the reforms in which he
          was interested. The peasants demanded that the gospel should be
          taught them as a guide in life, and that each community should be
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name=
          "Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> permitted to choose
          its pastor and depose him if he conducted himself improperly. More
          radical demands came from the working classes in the towns. The
          articles of Heilbronn demanded that the property of the Church
          should be confiscated and used for the community; clergy and
          nobility alike were to be deprived of all their privileges, so that
          they could no longer oppress the poor man. The more violent leaders
          renewed the old cry that the parsons must be slain. Hundreds of
          castles and monasteries were destroyed by the frantic peasantry,
          and some of the nobles were murdered with shocking cruelty. Luther,
          who believed that the peasants were trying to cloak their dreadful
          sins with excuses from the gospel, exhorted the government to put
          down the insurrection. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Have no pity on the
          poor folk; stab, smite, throttle, who can.’</span> The German
          rulers took Luther's advice with terrible literalness, and avenged
          themselves upon the peasants, whose lot was apparently worse
          afterwards than before.”</span>—Brit.</p>

          Church, and the second great sect-founder, has some slight

          VIII. himself stoutly maintained the headship of the pope, and as
          is well known, after examining the arguments of Luther, published
          his defence of the Seven Sacraments in 1521, which won for him from
          the pope the glorious title of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Defender of
          the faith.’</span> By 1527 the king had become hopeless of having a
          male heir by Catherine. He was tired of her, and in love with the
          black-eyed Anne Boleyn, who refused to be his mistress. The king's
          agents secured the opinion of a number of prominent universities
          that his marriage was void, and an assembly of notables, which he
          summoned in June 1530, warned the pope of the dangers involved in
          leaving the royal succession in uncertainty. Henry's next move was
          to bring a charge against the clergy, accusing them of having
          violated the ancient laws of praemunire in submitting to the
          authority of papal legates (although he himself had ratified the
          appointment of Wolsey as legate <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">a
          latere</span></span>). The clergy of the province of Canterbury
          were fined 100,000 pounds and compelled to declare the king their
          singular protector and only supreme lord, and, as far as that is
          permitted by the law of Christ, the supreme head of the Church and
          of the clergy.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The following year, 1532, an obedient parliament
          presented a petition to the king (which had been most carefully
          elaborated by the king's own advisers) containing twelve charges
          against the bishops. For the remedy of these abuses parliament
          turned to the king <span class="tei tei-q">‘in whom and by whom the
          only and sole redress, reformation and remedy herein absolutely
          rests and remains.’</span> [These charges were answered by the
          clergy, but the answer did not suit the king so on the 15th of May,
          1532.] The king's most humble subjects, daily orators and bedesmen
          of the clergy of England, in view of his goodness and fervent
          Christian zeal and his learning far exceeding that of all other
          kings that they have read of, agree never to assemble in
          convocation except at the king's summons, and to enact and
          promulgate no constitution or ordinances except they receive the
          royal assent and authority. [Then Henry divorced Catherine and
          married Anne Boleyn and the English Reformation was officially
          launched.] The king had now clarified the ancient laws of the realm
          to his satisfaction, and could proceed to seize such portions of
          the Church's possessions as he deemed superfluous for the
          maintenance of religion. [On the 30th of July, 1540, three Lutheran
          clergymen were burned and three Roman Catholics beheaded, the
          latter for denying the king's spiritual supremacy. The king's
          ardent desires that diversities of minds and opinions <span class=

          promoted by publishing in 1543 A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition
          for any Christian Man, set forth by the King's Majesty of England,
          in which the tenets of mediaeval theology, except for denial of the
          supremacy of the bishop of Rome and the unmistakable assertion of
          the supremacy of the king, were once more restated. The First
          Prayer Book of Edward VI was issued in 1549 and was followed in

          Calvin was not the inventor of the doctrine of election, but merely
          of the doctrine that all the non-elect would suffer everlastingly.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From an
          examination of history <span class="tei tei-q">“It does not appear
          that the Baptists were formed into any stability (as a sect) until
          the time of Menno, about the year 1536. About 1644 they began to
          make a considerable figure in England, and spread themselves into
          several separate congregations. They separated from the
          Independents about the year 1638, and set up for themselves under
          the pastoral care of Mr. Jesse; and, having renounced their former
          baptism, they sent over one of their number to be immersed by one
          of the Dutch Anabaptists of Amsterdam, that he might be qualified
          to baptize his friends in England after the same manner.”</span>
          (Buck.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Menno Simons, born in 1492 at
          Witmarsum in Friesland, at the age of 24 entered the priesthood.
          Doubts about transubstantiation made him uneasy; some of Luther's
          tracts fell in his way, and he was comforted by Luther's dictum
          that salvation does not depend on human dogmata. Hence he began to
          study the New Testament. The question as to the right age for
          baptism came up; he found this an open matter in the early church.
          Then the execution, in March, 1531, at Leeuwarden, of the tailor
          Sicke Freerks, who had been rebaptized in the previous December at
          Emden, introduced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
          153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          further questions. Menno was not satisfied with the inconsistent
          answers which he got from Luther, Bucer and Bullinger; he resolved
          to rely on Scripture alone, and from this time describes his
          preaching as evangelical, not sacramental. Anabaptism of the
          Munster type repelled him. A brother of Menno joined the insurgent
          followers of Matthyzoon and was killed at Bolsward, April 1535.
          Blaming the leaders by whom these poor people had been misled,
          Menno blamed himself for not having shown them a straight course.
          Accordingly on the 12th of January 1536 he left the Roman
          communion.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Among the so-called Anabaptists were four parties, the
          favorers of the Munster faction, the Batenburgers, extremists, the
          Melchiorites and the Obbenites. For a time Menno remained aloof
          from both Melchior Hofman and Obbe Philipsz. Before the year was
          out, yielding to the prayer of six or eight persons who had freed
          themselves from the Munster spell, he agreed to become their
          minister and was set apart January 1537 to the eldership at
          Groningen, with imposition of hands by Obbe Philipsz. Menno
          repudiated the formation of a sect; those who had experienced the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘new birth’</span> were to him the true
          Christian church. His Christology was in the main orthodox though
          he rejected terms such as Trinity which he could not find in
          Scripture. Of the introduction of Anabaptist views into England we
          have no certain knowledge. Fox relates that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the registers of London make mention of certain
          Dutchmen counted for Anabaptists, of whom ten were put to death in
          sundry places in the realm, anno 1535; other ten repented and were
          saved’</span>. In 1536 King Henry VIII issued a proclamation
          concerning faith agreed upon by Convocation, in which the clergy
          are told to instruct the people that they ought to repute and take
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Anabaptists' opinions for detestable
          heresies and to be utterly condemned.’</span> Thomas Fuller tells
          us from Stow's Chronicles that in the year 1538 four Anabaptists,
          three men and one woman, all Dutch, bare faggots at Paul's Cross,
          and three days after a man and woman of their sect were burnt in
          Smithfield. The early English Baptists, while they utterly rejected
          the baptism of infants, were as yet unpledged to immersion and
          rarely practiced it.”</span>—Brit.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“faiths”</span> are quite as varied as
          their names, but without exception they deny the central truth of
          the Scriptures (1 John 4:2, 3) that when Jesus Christ came to earth
          He came as a man only, devoid of immortality or Divinity, that when
          He died He was as dead as though He never had lived, and that by
          that death He bought for Adam and his race the Restitution of all
          things foretold by <span class="tei tei-q">“the mouth of all the
          holy Prophets since the world began.”</span> (Rev. 4:10.) The
          common ground upon which they stand is this, their denial of the
          Ransom, their affirmation of Spiritism, in some form, and their
          adherence to the principle of Federation. All of these things are
          condemned in the Scriptures but the Scriptures will never be
          allowed to stand in the way of those who live by shearing the wool
          from the sheep. (2 Tim. 4:3, 4; Deut. 18:10, 11; Isa. 8:9-22.) The
          latter passage is full of the deepest significance at this
          time.</p>

          system of religion by which men, by cultivation of the will, lift
          themselves into money, piety and immortality, and by making
          assertions to and demands of the alleged <span class=

          University, recently, in an address to the Y. M. C. A., is reported
          by the public press to have said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Wouldn't

          can't be here. In fact, I think I'd be rather discontented in
          Heaven till I got adjusted. You can get anything you want here. You
          can live under forty odd governments, meet all the nations of the
          world, eat all the fruits of the world and get any kind of climate
          that you choose. So America is the beat place to live; but I think
          when a man can't stay here any longer he ought to steer for
          Heaven,’</span> ”</span> (Z. '08-196.) Having concluded to stay
          here as long as possible, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Christians”</span> are now flocking by thousands to
          the purchase of works which will show them how to use spiritism to
          take advantage of their fellow men. The religious and other
          periodicals are now filled with advertisements of these books. We
          quote a few extracts to show their Satanic character:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is necessary to control others, to discover their
          plans. This you may be able to do if you have developed your inner
          faculties. We show you how to so develop your intuitional nature
          that you are able to detect the feelings of others; to penetrate
          their secret motives; and to discover what they try to conceal. The
          Golden Rule must be followed in controlling others. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Do unto others as you would that they should do unto
          you.’</span> There comes more and more the power of seeing the
          future, so that more and more true becomes the old adage that
          coming events cast their shadows before. Health in time takes the
          place of disease; for all disease and its consequent suffering is
          merely the result of the violation of law, whether consciously or
          unconsciously. There comes a spiritual power which, as it is sent
          out, is adequate for the healing of others the same as in the days
          of old.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Many omniscient men and women will soon walk the
          earth. Omniscience and Freedom are the goal of all, and in this

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Suddenly it seemed that the top of my head had been
          lifted, and I became aware of an immense increase of personal
          consciousness. I became conscious, I say—I know what I am
          writing—of the vast sky above, and the mighty deeps below, and the
          wide sweep of present human life, and the long forward and backward
          stretch of human history. It seemed that I could sense the All.
          Since that day all is well. Life is deeper, richer,
          stronger—assured, fearless, and saturated with perennial vital
          interests.”</span> (What really happened to this man was that he

          Church, foretold in the Scriptures. Among these errors none is
          designed to open the heart and mind to these delusive and

          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          surprisingly alert and active everywhere, especially in the United
          States, where thought is most active and where liberty often means
          license. Hundreds of thousands have embraced these errors as new
          and advanced light. The extent of their success is not fully
          apparent to many; for their success lies in a <em class=

          to block all progress in the science of life we may quote one

          Hilkiah Crooke, Physician and Professor on Anatomy and Chirurgery
          to His Majesty, James I. Speaking of the origin and growth of hair,
          he says: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The immediate matter of the
          haires is a sooty, thicke, and earthly vapour, which in the time of
          the third concoction (distillation) is elevated by the strength of
          the action of naturall heate, and passeth through the pores of the
          skin, which heate exiceateth or drieth this moysture of these
          sootie and thicke vapours, for the vapour being thicke, in his
          passage leaveth some part of it selfe, to wit, the grossest, in the
          very outlet, where it is impacted by a succeeding vapour arising
          where the former did, is protruded and thrust forward, so that they
          are wrought together in one body. The straightness of the passages
          of the skin were through the matter of the haires is anoyded,
          formeth them into a small roundness, even as a wyre receyeth that
          proportion whereof the whole is, where through it is
          drawne.’</span> One great office of the hairs of the head,
          therefore, Crooke perceived to be to lead off <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the vapors which otherwise would choke and make smoaky
          the braine,’</span> though how hopelessly choked the brains of all
          bald heads hence would be he does not mention.”</span> A study of
          the foregoing leads to the conclusion that the various churches
          must have been founded by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg

          forth this first volume of the MILLENNIAL DAWN, it is but proper
          that we apologize to the many friends who have waited for it so
          patiently since promised.”</span> (A. 3.) Volume II was published
          in 1889, and III in 1891. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some have urged
          greater haste in the writing and publishing of the several volumes
          of this series, and, to a large extent, I have shared the same
          feelings of impatience; but my observations of the Lord's dealings
          and leadings and unfoldings of His Plan are gradually convincing me
          that He has not shared our impatience. Indeed, I can clearly trace
          His hand in some of the hindrances encountered and can realize by
          the delay I have been enabled to grasp the subjects more
          thoroughly, and to present them more fully, than if the work had
          been hastened more. Not only has this delay worked for my good and
          yours, but in another way also. It has afforded time for a more
          thorough digestion of the truths of each volume, and thereby has
          given to the faithful student the very necessary preparation for
          that which was to follow. And not only so, but it has also given
          opportunity for practicing the lessons learned, and for exercising
          the talents of each in spreading the advancing light before others
          of God's saints.”</span> (C. 12.) Volume IV was published in 1897,
          V in 1899, VI in 1904 and VII in 1917. This makes a total lapse of
          36 years from the publication of <span class=

          CHRISTIANS</span></span> to the last volume of the <span class=

          STUDIES</span></span>. Meantime the Harvest work grew to a movement
          of vast proportions; and Volume VII was delayed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The French
          Revolution lasted ten and a half years, from June 17th, 1789, when
          the Assembly began its reign, until Napoleon seized the government
          and caused himself to be appointed First Consul, November 9th,
          1799. This coincides well with the thought previously expressed
          (Rev. 7:3) that all phases of Babylon will not be disposed of until
          about ten and a half years from the fall of 1914. The Assembly was
          in control from the first, but did not execute the king until
          January 21st, 1793, three years and one-half from the time the
          trouble started. The Assembly continued in control until June 25th,
          1795, six years from the time the trouble began, when the
          government was intrusted to five persons under the name of the
          Directory. It was on October 4th of the same year that Napoleon
          cleared the streets of Paris of the mobs, and from that point
          onward his star began to rise. Some interesting developments in
          connection with the setting up of the Kingdom may occur in 1920,
          six years after the great Time of Trouble began. It would not be
          strange if this were so, when we recall that after forty years
          wandering in the wilderness the Israelites came into possession of
          the land of Canaan after a further six years. As these matters are
          still future we can but wait to see. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Ostrogoths, Heruli and Vandals. The five potential races in the
          West were the Franks, Britons, Saxons, Visigoths and Suevi. During
          the next one hundred and fifty years great migrations and invasions
          have so confused history that there is great difference of opinion
          among historians on many important details. It is plain, however,
          that three of the migratory races disappeared from history, all
          within a few years of each other, apparently in order to leave Rome
          and its environs free for the development of the papacy. The
          Heruli, a race from Germanic territory, disappeared from Italian
          territory in A. D. 489; the Vandals, a race from the shores of the
          Baltic (never in control of Rome except on a brief raid, but a
          great enemy of the papacy) disappeared in A. D. 534; and the
          Ostrogoths, an Asiatic race, in A. D. 539. The Western Empire
          itself disappeared in A. D. 476. The matter is treated by Pastor
          Russell at greater length in C. 76, 77, and all his statements are,
          of course, correct.</p>

          corresponding to the present Austria, we may see the two horns
          which remained of the five Eastern powers after the Ostrogoths,

          Saxonia, corresponding to Germany and Scandinavia; and Britannia,
          corresponding to Great Britain, we may see the five horns which
          represented the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
          185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          five western powers. The following explains why Italy is not
          included in the list:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The difficulty of Italian history lies in the fact
          that until modern times the Italians have had no political unity,
          no independence, no organized existence as a nation. Split up into
          numerous and mutually hostile communities, they never, through the
          fourteen centuries which have elapsed since the end of the old
          Western Empire, shook off the yoke of foreigners completely; they
          never until lately learned to merge their local and conflicting
          interests in the common good of undivided Italy. Their history is
          therefore not the history of a single people, centralizing and
          absorbing its constituent elements by a process of continued
          evolution, but a group of cognate populations, exemplifying divers
          types of constitutional developments.”</span>—Brit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          justifies Pastor Russell's thought that the Western Empire should
          be counted as one of the horns rooted up to make way for the
          Papacy. As to whether it or the Vandal race should be counted as
          the third horn, since both were destroyed, is a matter of no great
          importance to us. The point of greatest interest now is that the
          Lord is about to destroy the other seven, including the Papacy. All
          the powers named, except Spain, are already in the great War.
          Indeed, except South America, which expects to be dragged in, the
          only countries of the world not now (June, 1917) engaged in the war
          are Scandinavia, Holland, Switzerland, Spain, Abyssinia and
          Mexico.—Jer. 25:15-38.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And

          maintain his capital at Rome. <span class="tei tei-q">“After the
          senate and people of Rome had ceased to be the sovereigns of the
          Roman world, and their authority had been vested in the sole person
          of the emperor, the eternal city could no longer claim to be the
          rightful throne of the state. That honor could henceforth be
          conferred upon any place in the Roman world which might suit the
          convenience of the emperor, or serve more efficiently the interests
          he had to guard. Furthermore, the empire was now upon its defense.
          When Constantine, therefore, established a new seat of government
          at Byzantium, he adopted a policy inaugurated before his day as
          essential to the preservation of the Roman dominion. He can claim
          originality only in his choice of the particular point at which
          that seat was placed, and in his recognition of the fact that his
          alliance with the Christian church could be best maintained in the
          new atmosphere. The city was founded by Constantine the Great,
          through the enlargement of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          inaugurated as a new seat of government on the 11th of May, A. D.
          330. To indicate its political dignity, it was named New Rome,
          while to perpetuate the name of its founder it was styled
          Constantinople. The chief patriarch of the Greek church still signs

          Constantine saw a vision—probably when wide awake—a vision of
          greater prosperity for himself and his Empire, by a recognition of
          Christianity as the religion of his Empire instead of paganism,
          which had previously been recognized. Constantine's influence in
          Church affairs became great. He proposed the calling of a council
          of all the bishops, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">numbering about one thousand</span></em>. He
          wanted to know why these apostolic bishops, all inspired with the
          same Spirit of God, taught so differently. He offered to pay the
          expenses of all the bishops to the Council of Nice; but the
          majority, fearing that the Emperor would be under the control of
          the Roman bishop (not yet claiming to be pope), declined to attend.
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Only 384
          came.</span></em> But even they were unable to agree. Many held to
          the Bible teaching, but the mystification thought of trinity had
          gained a hold on some of the bishops. Thereupon Constantine decided
          the matter; and the Nicene Creed, backed by the Emperor's power,
          was declared to be the Christian faith, and anything contrary to
          it, heresy. Yet be it remembered that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only about
          one-third</span></em> of the bishops were present at the Council;
          and that they could not be coerced into substituting <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘mystery’</span> for the Word of God, until the Emperor
          lent his influence. Thus was the mystery of trinity enshrined by a
          heathen emperor, not baptized—not even sprinkled. The history of
          the persecution of all who would not worship the trinitarian
          mystery would fill volumes. One sad illustration is familiar to
          all—the burning of Servetus, by good Brother Calvin's signature to
          the death warrant. Is it any wonder that with such conditions
          prevailing for centuries, the Bible ignored and the creeds
          worshipped, the true teachings of the Bible on many subjects were
          completely lost sight of? Is it any wonder that, when in the
          sixteenth century God began to bring the Bible back to the
          attention of the world, it was burned by the Episcopal bishops in
          front of St. Paul's Cathedral in London? Is it any wonder that the
          Christians of that time were persecuted for studying it, and could
          meet only in secret?”</span>—B. S. M.</p>

          that none of the beasts of earth could be compared with it. John
          the Revelator, seeing in vision the same symbolic beast

          it, and finally gives it several. Among others, he called it
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Devil.’</span> He certainly chose an
          appropriate name; for Rome, when viewed in the light of its bloody
          persecutions, certainly has been the most devilish of all earthly
          governments. Even in its change from Rome Pagan to Rome Papal it
          illustrated one of Satan's chief characteristics; for he also
          transforms himself to appear as an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:14),

          very forcibly delineated even in the names applied to it by the
          inspired writers. Paul calls it <span class="tei tei-q">‘That
          Wicked One,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Man of
          Sin,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Mystery of
          Iniquity,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Antichrist,’</span>
          and <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Son of Perdition;’</span> the
          Prophet Daniel calls it <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Abomination
          that maketh desolate’</span> (Dan. 11:31; 12:11); and our Lord
          refers to the same character as <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
          Abomination of Desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet’</span>
          (Matt. 24:15). This same character was also prefigured by a little
          horn, or power, out of a terrible beast that Daniel saw in his
          prophetic vision, which had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great
          things, and which prospered and made war with the saints, and
          prevailed against them. (Dan. 7:8, 21.) John also saw and warned
          the Church against this character, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Ye have heard that Antichrist shall come.’</span> He
          then advises how to escape Antichrist's influence. (1 John
          2:18-27.) These various appellations and brief descriptions
          indicate a base, subtle, hypocritical, deceptive, tyrannical and
          cruel character, developed in the midst of the Christian Church;
          claiming, to the last, peculiar sanctity and authority and power
          from God.”</span> (B. 271.) <span class="tei tei-q">“We need not
          look long to find a character fitting all the requirements
          perfectly. But when we state that the one and only system whose
          history fits these prophecies is Papacy, let no one misunderstand
          us to mean that every Roman Catholic is a man of sin. Popes,
          bishops and others are at most only parts or members of the
          Antichrist system, even as all of the Royal Priests are only
          members of the true Christ.”</span> (B. 277.) Antichrist now finds
          its expression in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian”</span>
          governments of the world founded upon its
          teachings—Christendom.</p>

          57:20. At the time of papacy's birth the masses of the Roman people

          a shrewd politician, discerned this and discerned the growing
          influence of the Christian religion. In adopting it, in forcing the
          adoption of the Nicene Creed, and in removing his capital from
          Rome, he gave the papacy its start.</p>

          to be the ruler of all kingdoms, is based on the claim that it is
          the center of wisdom, learning and piety. Other peculiarities of
          the Leopard are its activity, vigilance and secretiveness; so with
          Papacy. Again, a Leopard is spotted irregularly, so too Papacy's

          depravity of the people it rules with its rod of eternal torment
          and its staff of Purgatory. In Spain, for example, which has been
          for centuries one of its dark spots—as dark as the general
          civilization of the people will permit,—the <span class=

          strengthened rather than weakened by allegiance to Papacy, for
          Papacy in turn recognized them, and commanded the people to
          recognize those despots as of divine appointment. Thus it is, that
          to this day, the rulers of Europe claim to rule by Divine right and
          appointment, and their children after them, no matter how
          incompetent. For the same reason the Protestant churches of Europe,

          churches, and they, as Papacy did, recognize the reigning families
          as possessed of Divine title to the office and rulership of the

          have just seen, then this beast called another should be understood
          to represent a similar ecclesiastical or church power. As the first

          this beast has <span class="tei tei-q">‘two horns’</span> which

          notice that this beast <span class="tei tei-q">‘ascended (came

          the sea. Now, if our definitions be correct—as the coming of Papacy

          should signify that it sprung up among a professedly religious
          people. The Two-horned Beast is one ecclesiastical system, and the
          two horns show that it is supported, and its authority recognized
          by two kingdoms. Remember that to be simply aided or supported by
          the empire does not make a symbolic <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Beast’</span>; a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Beast’</span> is a government, and to become a
          symbolic beast, a church must needs become an element in, or part
          of the government.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is but one church which this symbol fits
          perfectly, viz.: The established <span class="tei tei-q">‘Church of
          England and Ireland.’</span> This system, like the Papal, was a
          blending of church and state, an ecclesiastical empire. In the year
          1200 England became subject to the Pope. In 1531, owing to a
          dispute between her king, Henry VIII, and the Pope, England
          withdrew from allegiance to Papacy. The Convocation of its clergy
          called the same year, in its decrees, declared King Henry VIII to
          be <span class="tei tei-q">‘The one protector of the English
          Church, its only and Supreme Lord; and as far as might be, by the
          law of Christ, its Supreme Head.’</span> Those are the exact
          sentiments of Papacy; that is exactly the sense in which the Pope
          is recognized as Christ's vice-gerent. What a glorious
          representation of the Lord Jesus they had in Henry VIII, who, out
          of six wives, was divorced from two, beheaded two, and by many is
          supposed to have poisoned one! He was a worthy rival of some of the
          Popes as an Anti-christian claimant of headship to the church. The
          Clerical Convocation which could acknowledge such a head was not
          far from being as corrupt as Papacy.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The proof that the title, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘head of the church,’</span> was not an empty honor,
          appears from the historian's words—<span class="tei tei-q">‘At the
          same time it was ordained that no regard should be paid to censures
          which the Pope might pass on account of this law and that Mass
          should be said, and sacraments administered as usual. In 1534, all
          payments made to the apostolic chamber, and dispensations, were
          abolished; monasteries were subjected to royal government, and
          exempted from all other; the right to summon Convocations, approve
          or reject canons (laws or doctrines enacted by the Convocation of
          clergy), and hear appeals from the Bishops, was vested in the King
          alone. These matters are but imperfectly understood by people in
          general, and the same titles—<span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme head
          of the church on earth,”</span> etc., are still applied to English
          sovereigns. It is needless to remark that the Lord Jesus never gave
          this office to any one, but claims it Himself; and any others who
          claim it are usurpers. Paul said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ
          is the Head of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg
          201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Church,”</span> and that we are to <span class="tei tei-q">“grow up
          into Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ.”</span>
          Again he repeats that <span class="tei tei-q">“God gave Him to be
          the Head over all things in the Church, which is His body.”</span>
          (Eph. 1:22 and 4:15, and 5:23; Col. 1:18.) It is the church on
          earth that Paul is speaking of, hence any Pope, Queen, Council,
          Assembly, Conference, or any other man or company of men, who claim
          or exercise the powers of the true Head—Jesus—are opposing Him. And
          all who support such by influence, presence or money, are abettors
          of evil and supporters of false systems. Now does this system (the
          English church) fill the picture? The second Beast had two horns;
          what two kingdoms (horns) supported this church? Bear in mind the
          distinction between a church supported by a government, as the
          Presbyterian in Scotland, and a church united in the government, as
          in England; it is the latter relationship that constitutes a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“beast.”</span> ’</span> ”</span>—Z.

          horns like a lamb.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Now about
          the two horns. England, of course, was one of them, and Ireland the
          other. Let us see. History says that in 1537 the Irish Parliament
          in Dublin <span class="tei tei-q">‘passed the Act of Supremacy,
          declaring Henry VIII Supreme Head of the Church, prohibiting
          intercourse with the court of Rome, and making it treason to refuse
          the oath of supremacy.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Henry VIII
          also took the title of King of Ireland.’</span> Thus it is seen
          that the second horn came up within the brief space of five years
          after the first. The fact that Ireland was not a powerful horn
          matters not, for it was stronger than some that supported the Papal
          Beast. What effects result from the disestablishment of the Church
          in Ireland? From 1538 to 1871 (333 years), the title of the church
          was <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Church of England and
          Ireland,’</span> thus recognizing both <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘horns.’</span> On January 1, 1871 (by action of
          Parliament and the consent of the Queen, the head of the church)
          the Irish church was disestablished, or that horn was cast off. So,
          too, all of the horns which once supported Papacy have broken off
          from her; the difference being that in the case of Papacy the horns
          have turned against her, and in the case of the second Beast it
          casts off the Irish horn of itself, believing it to be a weakness
          rather than a strength. And it would not be at all remarkable if
          the other horn (England) would be separated from this Beast.
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘The two horns like a lamb,’</span> would
          seem to indicate that this Beast would be peaceably inclined—not
          aggressive, but merely using the horns for defense.”</span>—Z.

          the Body of Christ, under the combination of governments dominated
          by Great Britain, may be expected to be as great as in Papacy's
          palmiest days.</p>

          England claimed all the powers and authority which Papacy claimed.
          It claimed to be the Church; it acknowledged and repudiated some of
          the corruptions complained of by the Reformers, such as the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name=
          "Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sale of indulgence,
          transubstantiation, etc., and abandoned these as well as the name
          Roman, for which they substituted the word Holy, calling it the
          original <span class="tei tei-q">‘Holy Catholic Church.’</span> It
          claims the same governmental authority and the same veneration for
          its decrees as Papacy does for hers. And by establishing a similar
          system, devoid of some of the grosser Papal errors, it attracted
          the attention of all to those errors, as being the only possible
          fault of Papacy. And when some of those errors were shortly after
          discarded by Papacy, the inference was that both Beast systems were
          right. People at that day, as now, seemed to think those systems
          proper and right, if their powers, etc., were properly exercised;
          but from God's standpoint the systems are abominations, and wrong
          from the very center. These systems are based upon errors, and like
          a corrupt tree, <span class="tei tei-q">‘cannot bring forth good

          once admitted, justifies their persecution of individuals and
          nations, forcing them to submit and bow in obedience. Scripture
          accords these powers to the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Kingdom of

          tongue confess. (Phil. 2:11.) And if their claim be good, who can
          object to their carrying out the Scriptural statements? These
          Antichrists, to make their claim of kingdom power appear true, had
          simply to take another, viz., to compel obedience, backing up their
          right to do so by the Scriptures just quoted. And not only was this
          great evil sanctioned, but their claim, once admitted, that the
          Kingdom was established and the reign in progress, those who
          admitted it were hindered from looking for the true Head of the
          Church to set up the true Kingdom under the whole heavens, which
          shall break in pieces present imperfect governments, establish

          popular magazines vie with each other in saying nice things about
          mediums and their ways. The cause of this change in public opinion
          has been a similar change in scientific belief. It is not more than
          thirty years ago that orthodox science refused so much as to
          investigate the things of which we are speaking. Some twenty-five
          years ago the Society for Psychical Research was formed in England
          with such names as Crookes, Myers, Romanes, Eidgwick, Barrett and
          others on its list of members, and since that day telepathy, table
          rapping, clairvoyance, clairaudience, telekinesis, apparitions,

          Mediums have been transferred from back parlors, where all sorts of
          trickery was possible, to the physical laboratories of the
          universities. They have been put under conditions of strictest
          control. Even the traditional darkness has been denied them. And
          still the wonderful results came. One after another leading
          scientists entered into these investigations skeptical and
          contemptuous, but came out of them believers in the facts on the
          evidence of their own senses.’</span> ”</span>—Z. '09-164.</p>

          numbers of new sects arose, whereas before that, they were few and
          prominent. This gave rise to uneasiness among the older
          denominations who wondered whereunto this thing would lead. As the
          Bible came to be read more and more by the masses, occasional
          individuals would feel free to preach what they thought it taught,
          regardless of denominational creeds and the views of the older
          sects. As a consequence, Protestants were fast splitting up into
          fragments. They began to say, By what means shall we check and stop
          this disposition to individual thought and opinion relative to the
          teachings of Scripture? They wanted to stop the very thing God
          desired; viz., that each individual <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> should be free and independent of restraint,
          with his faith based, not on the views of others, not on the
          decisions of Councils or Presbyters, nor in the decision of the
          Pope, nor in things approved of the head of the English church, but
          in the Word of God. The question came: How can we restrain these
          preachers? This was a quandary to all except the Roman and
          Episcopal churches, since these both claimed the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Apostolic Succession,’</span> and that this, by
          ordination, conferred upon their ministers special power and
          authority to preach and to administer the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Sacraments’</span>; hence that no others had a right
          to do so, but were clerical pretenders. Other denominations could
          not claim this continuation of apostolic power through their
          preachers, but simply set them apart by prayer, consequently those
          of one denomination could not object that the preachers of other
          denominations, as well as all laymen, were not as truly authorized
          of God to expound the Scriptures as their own clergy.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But the example of the Church of England showed what a
          prestige she had by reason of the voice of authority with which she
          commanded a reverence for her clergy and her teachings. This
          teaching by example was not lost. The various denominations felt a
          necessity for some common Standard of Doctrine which would be
          supported and upheld by all of them, and thus give prestige to
          their teachings, and bring the combined influence of all against
          any further advance in knowledge or the development of any
          different phase of truth. Thus they would protect themselves by
          being able to say: The combined opinion of all Protestants is
          against you; therefore you are heretics, and therefore we will shun
          you, and not call you Brethren, but use all our influence against
          you. This was done by the formation of the <span class=

          Evangelical Alliance. Strange to say, the delegates to the Alliance
          had so far lost sight of the principles and doctrines which led to
          the protests against the Papal church (that it was the Harlot
          church—Antichrist—Man of Sin—mentioned in the Scriptures) that they
          actually felt flattered by the Pontiff's notice, instead of
          becoming alarmed and examining how and why he who is <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘The Chief Antichrist’</span> should feel pleased to
          greet them as fellows. A prominent Presbyterian minister present at
          the above named meeting mentioned the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Pope's Greeting’</span> with evident pleasure and
          satisfaction to the writer.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A prominent characteristic of the Beast copied by the
          Image is the honoring of a special class, the Clergy, with special
          honors and titles. They are known as Revs., Divines, etc., but
          Jesus the Divine said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ye call Me Lord and
          Master, and ye say well, for so I am.’</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Be not ye called Rabbi, neither be ye called Master,
          for one is your Master, even Christ, and all ye are
          brethren.’</span> (Matt. 23:8.) These titles are assumptions
          fashioned after those of Papacy. When the various denominations
          began their existence, more full of the spirit of Christ, they
          claimed no such high-sounding titles. The Reformers were not known
          as Rev., D. D., etc., but as John Knox, Martin Luther, etc.
          Unpretentious, like Jesus and the Apostles, they were intent upon
          serving God, and therefore became the servants (ministers) of the
          Church. But now the Clergy are far from being servants; they are
          Lords. They have itching ears, loving the approval of men. As pride
          and worldliness have come in, vital godliness and power have
          gradually departed. For the very same reason, they are losing all
          power to expound the Word of God—the gift of teaching—because
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘God abhorreth the proud, but giveth grace
          (favor) to the humble.’</span> We find ministers of all
          denominations ready to confess their ignorance of the Word. They
          appeal, for their information, back to the early reformers, and
          thus confess that they have less light than they. That their light
          should grow dim, and their spiritual life become dwarfed, is the
          natural result of their joining the Image, and subscribing to
          creeds made in the fifteenth century, which, like the shoe of
          China, will not admit of any growth. It is a shoe a little larger
          than Papacy put upon its followers, but of the same
          sort.</span></p>

          explained—<span class="tei tei-q">‘One is your Master; all ye are

          Spirit of Truth] and compacted by that which every joint supplied

          the knowledge of the Son of God.’</span> (Eph. 4:15, 16.) As Papacy
          established the priesthood over the church, so Protestantism has
          established the same, and there is no opportunity for the Body to
          edify itself, every joint taking part. True, there is a seeming
          show of liberty at prayer meetings, etc., but it is only upon the
          surface, for the ordained pastor is to watch zealously lest
          anything contrary to the teachings of his church should be
          expressed, and if so, to silence the audacious member at once, for
          the church creed is the rule, not the Word of God. If this is not
          sufficient, they must have a sort of church trial and excommunicate
          him (<span class="tei tei-q">‘kill him’</span>). The trial, by the
          way, gives evidence of another likeness to the Beast, namely, the
          exaltation of the teachings of the organization above the Word of
          God, for all such are tried according to <span class=

          of the Image is to come from the two-horned Beast; the Church of
          England. A few years ago the Episcopal Church took an important
          step toward vitalizing the Church Federation movement. That
          important step was the recognition of the ministers of the
          denominations represented in the Evangelical Alliance. Previously
          no minister not ordained by the laying on of hands of a Catholic or
          an Episcopalian bishop was allowed to preach from an Episcopalian
          pulpit. Perhaps this recognition of the Image is all the
          vitalization the Image needs, but we are inclined to expect more.
          For years the Episcopalians have proffered reordination to the
          ministers of the different denominations represented in the
          Evangelical Alliance. And they still proffer it. We have been
          inclined to expect that the ministers would finally concede the
          point and accept a reordination at the hands of an Episcopal
          bishop. But we are not sure of this. It is possible that, to meet
          the requirements of the case, some other way will be found by which
          the Episcopal Church will recognize the Church Federation without
          obligating the ministers to be reordained. We are waiting for
          this.”</span> (Z. '13-343.) <span class="tei tei-q">“If the various
          ministers of other denominations in considerable numbers accept
          reordination as ministers at the hands of Episcopalian Bishops, the
          validity of other ordination will be speedily questioned. The
          authority of this so-called <span class="tei tei-q">‘Apostolic
          Ordination’</span> will give seeming right of authority, dignity
          and power. After the prominent ministers of various denominations

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          had a part in the crime of Calvary, and yet it did, and that the
          chief part. The ecclesiastical mind is a closed mind—and there is
          nothing it resents so much as being pried open to receive a new
          idea. Its settled rule of judgment, its accepted test of truth, is,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘What is new is never true, and what is

          through the streets of Jerusalem, bound for the Governor's Palace.
          Who compose this procession? They are the religious leaders of the
          people the prominent divines, the chief ecclesiastics. What is the

          New Testaments into London, in whose shops the people began to
          purchase them. At this same time the Germans were learning
          something of the New Testament and its different teachings, from
          Luther and his associates. The Church of England bishops forthwith
          bought up the entire edition in the shops, and publicly burnt them
          in front of St Paul's Cathedral, London. They knew that the
          eighteen Ecumenical Councils had declared to be true Christian
          faith many things not taught in the Bible, and had omitted many
          things that are taught therein. They feared that the people,

          possible, indeed probable we think, that John's course which
          brought him into conflict with Herod was in some degree typical of
          the course of the Gospel Church in this present time; and of the
          course of events that may be expected. If it be a type, Herod would
          represent civil government, and the unlawful wife would represent
          the nominal church, which throughout the symbolic Scriptures is
          represented as a woman, Jezebel, etc. Should it prove to be a type
          by its fulfilment in antitype, the fulfilment will probably be on
          something like the following lines: (1) A partial reunion

          [This has now been accomplished by the Alliance of the United
          States with Great Britain.] (2) In such case it would become the
          duty of the true Church, the forerunners and announcers of the
          Messianic Kingdom, to reprove the civil powers as well as the
          nominal church systems, and to declare their union
          unlawful—contrary to the Word of God. (3) The effect of this would
          pretty surely be to awaken the animosity of both civil and
          religious powers; but it would draw out specially the animosity and
          venom of the latter. (4) The church nominal, in her false position
          would be anxious to stifle the reproofs and to destroy the
          reprovers, and the effect would be that the civil power would be
          induced to pass such legislation as would restrain the liberty of
          the faithful ones and hinder them from public utterances;—as John
          was hindered by imprisonment. (5) Herodias' daughter (united
          Protestantism) will become the tool for the destruction of the most
          loyal servants of God.”</span>—Z. '98-95.</p>

          person, lately, was witnessing a ceremony of the Romish Church. As
          the pope passed him in the procession, splendidly dressed in his
          pontifical robes, the gentleman's eye rested on these full, blazing
          letters in front of his mitre (tiara—crown): VICARIVS FILII DEI,
          the Vicar of the Son of God. His thoughts, with the rapidity of

          crown in the Vatican museum is the recognized and most used title
          of the pope, VICARIVS FILII DEI (Vicar of the Son of God.) The word
          VICARIVS is on the top of the threefold crown. The word FILII is on
          the second circlet; and the words are made from dark, shining
          precious jewels. The word DEI is on the under part of the threefold
          crown and is made of 100 diamonds. <span class="tei tei-q">“The

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by Pope Constantine, in A. D. 715. It
          first appears on papal coins in the reign of Sergius III., A. D.
          911. At this period it was merely a cap of white stuff. The papal
          coins of the 11th century leave it doubtful whether the ornamental
          band at the lower edge of the tiara is intended to represent a
          crown or merely a decoration. It is only in representations dating
          from the late 13th century that the circlet appears as a regular
          spiked crown. The second circlet was added by Pope Boniface VIII.,
          A. D. 1303. The third was added under Clement V., A. D.
          1311.”</span> (Brit.) The reason for the addition of any of these
          crowns is unknown, or why the pope should have any crown at all.
          The words VICARIVS FILII DEI are, it is said, also carved over the
          entrance to the Vatican.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“All Bible exponents of the Protestant kind recognize
          there are two Women especially mentioned in Revelation; the one the
          true Woman, the Bride class, the other the false Woman; and
          Protestants in general understand that false Woman to represent the
          papacy. Then again other Protestants understand that the Scriptures
          which refer to the mother and daughters refer to the papacy, and
          these denominational daughters, or systems, which sprang from her,
          and have more or less of her nature, disposition and
          characteristics. The Bible proposition is that the Church is a
          Virgin Church; viz.: not united to the world at all, and that this
          is the error that was made by the early Church in leaving Christ
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name=
          "Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as the prospective
          Bridegroom and becoming united with the nation of Rome. This
          constituted an illicit union; for as the Bride of Christ she had no
          right whatever to be associated with any earthly dominion;
          therefore in becoming associated with the Roman Emperor she lost
          her standing. We are to remember that this word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘harlotry’</span> as used in Revelation is merely a
          symbolical term; there is nothing more than that to be understood.
          God speaks of some of His children as being in Babylon. Babylon is
          the name for the mother, the papal system, and the daughters also
          have the same name. It means confusion, mixture and improper
          relationship. Now then some are in Babylon and not of Babylon, just
          the same as the children of Israel were carried captive into
          Babylon, but they were not Babylonians. And in due time God sent
          forth the Message to all Natural Israel that if those who had been
          carried in captivity into Babylon desired to return to the Lord
          their God, and to the Land of Promise, they might do so. Cyrus gave
          that decree, you remember, and many of them did return.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No one is called out of Babylon until he hears the
          Lord's voice. So you and I may have been in Babylon for years and
          not have had any responsibility or any impurity; we were not
          defiled, because we did not know any better. But He says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Come out of her, My people, that ye be not
          partakers of her sins.’</span> That implies that you are not yet
          partakers of her sins; you are My people, in her, but not yet
          partakers. I was not responsible for what was in my head from
          childhood; and God did not hold me responsible; nor you, nor anyone
          else; but after we come to see the great errors which are taught by
          Babylon's system then we are responsible. We have said things about
          our Heavenly Father that we would be ashamed to say about ourselves
          or of our earthly parents.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have said He created our world of mankind and knew
          what He was doing, had full power and full wisdom, and intended
          from the beginning to damn nine hundred and ninety-nine out of
          every thousand, and to have them roast through all eternity; and
          that He made fireproof devils to handle them; that He created a
          great place called hell in which all of this diabolical work was
          going on. No honorable man would treat a poor rat that
          way—predestinate the rat before it was born, foreordain it to
          eternal torture. And now then after we once see that this doctrine
          is blasphemy against God, after we once see that it was evidently
          instigated by our great Adversary, the Devil—after we once see what
          an awful thing it is—if then we wish to uphold earthly systems and
          give our lives, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
          220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          strength, talents and means, to upholding these diabolical
          teachings, then we are worse than any others there; we are the
          worst of them all. What right has any man to stay inside of a
          denomination and deny the teachings of that denomination? He is
          branding himself as a fraud, professing to believe what he knows he
          does not believe, claiming to teach what he knows he should not
          teach; or, on the other hand, teaching that which he knows is
          wrong, and professing that which he does not believe at all. The
          whole matter is wrong; such are defiled by the Women.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But those who come out when they see the right and
          wrong on the question, who take their stand for right, they are
          delivering their souls from Babylon. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Flee
          out of Babylon, saith the Lord; deliver every man his soul.’</span>
          Now no one is responsible to flee out unless he sees that it is
          Babylon, but the very suggestion that it is Babylon to every honest
          person means that he should make an investigation, and a thorough
          one, to know whether or not he is in Babylon. If he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, God's voice says <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“flee out of Babylon,”</span> and I believe that the
          system is Babylon, but I do not wish to look into it for fear I
          find it true,’</span> that means he is dishonest with himself; he
          is defiling himself. There is only one way of being thoroughly
          honest, and that is to be honest.”</span> (Pastor Russell.)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That the words can only be understood
          spiritually seems to follow from the whole tone of Apocalyptic
          symbolism:—see the mention of the Bridegroom and the Bride, of the
          Harlot and her fornications. Elsewhere we have the language of Ps.
          45, of the Canticles, of the Book of Hosea, above all of 2 Cor.
          11:2:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘I have espoused you to one Husband,

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The name Babylon was applied, not only to
          the capital city of the Babylonian empire, but also to the empire
          itself. Babylon, the capital, was the most magnificent, and
          probably the largest, city of the ancient world. It was built in
          the <span class="tei tei-q">‘form of a square on both sides of the
          Euphrates river; and, for protection against invaders, it was
          surrounded by a deep moat filled with water and inclosed within a
          vast system of double walls, from thirty-two to eighty-five feet
          thick, and from seventy-five to three hundred feet high. On the
          summit were low towers, said to have been two hundred and fifty in
          number, placed along the outer and inner edges of the wall, tower
          facing tower; and in these walls were a hundred brazen gates,
          twenty-five on each side, corresponding to the number of streets
          which intersected each other at right angles. The city was adorned
          with splendid palaces and temples and the spoils of

          certainty of the fall: see chapters 10:7; 11:18; 18:2; and see on

          denoting the violent fall and overthrow of kingdoms—see Ezek. 30:6;
          and see on chapter 17:10. With the fall of Babylon, the capital of
          the ungodly world-kingdom, the Old Testament connects the

          by Darwin and Socrates, among men of intellect. Nasal abbreviation
          is one of the well-known signs of degeneracy, as is also the
          sessile or otherwise misshapen ear, the sugar-loaf skull, the
          close-set eyes, and other physiognomic irregularities, including
          the cretinoid face. The latter, strange to relate, has been noted
          in certain men of remarkable genius, including Darwin and Carlyle,
          Rembrandt, Pope and Socrates. I wish to emphasize at this point the
          assertion that not every individual who chances to possess one of
          the above mentioned physical peculiarities is to be immediately
          stamped as a degenerate. It is only when there is a combination of
          two or more of these traits, especially if this combination has
          been noted as a family peculiarity, that the suspicion will be
          awakened; and this may then be confirmed and the condition
          established by close and careful investigation.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Socrates,”</span> writes Pedigo,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“presented one of the most interesting
          studies in dual personality and subconscious conditions in all

          the ones directly responsible for the war in Europe. It was not
          their province to convince the rulers of those countries that their

          love and truth—monstrous! They are an entirely unauthorized

          brought upon their heads the blood of all the nations of the earth

          only. What city more appropriate to refer to then than the Bethel,
          the Divinely appointed center for the Harvest work, the embryo

          time when we could not sing this song (Psa. 137). We looked forward
          with dread to the time when the Lord's judgments would be made
          manifest. We did not see that the Judgment Day is a day of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“assurance to all men.”</span> (Acts
          17:31.) We did not see that the first judgment day was against our
          race (Rom. 5:18), and that no culprit can be on trial twice for the
          same offence. We did not see that another Judgment Day, favorable
          to our race, came at the time of our Lord's great victory over
          death (John 12:31); nor did we see that our own, the Judgment Day
          of the saints, is here and now. (1 Tim. 5:24; 1 Cor. 11:31; 1 Pet.
          4:17.) We did perhaps note, our duty of judging wolves by their
          greed, dogs by their quarrelsomeness, swine by their interest in
          earthly things, thorns by their disposition to wound and tear, and
          thistles by their disposition to scatter seeds that cause trouble
          (Matt. 7:6, 16, 15); and some of us went beyond and began judging
          one another (Rom. 14:13; Matt. 7:1). We never wanted the Lord to do
          it, even though we do know that He will bring every secret thing
          into judgment. (Prov. 15:3; Ecc. 12:14.) Now we see that the
          world's Judgment Day is a thousand years long (Psa. 90:4; 2 Pet.
          3:7, 8); we have learned that a day is not always merely a 24-hour
          period. (Gen. 2:4; Heb. 3:8; 2 Cor. 6:2.) We see now that our Lord
          Jesus at the first Advent judged nobody (John 12:47; Luke 12:14),
          but that God has exalted Him to be the world's Judge (Acts 5:31) a
          Deliverer (Judges 3:9; Isa. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Cor. 6:2; Rev. 20:6); that His judgments will end war, promote
          righteousness and aid the poor and needy (Isa. 2:4; 11:4; 26:9),
          destroy unrighteousness and bring in everlasting peace and joy.—2

          book, from the standpoint of the clergy, is afforded by the plague
          of flies (Ex. 8:20-32.) It seemed to them like an old-time Egyptian
          curse, with which they were quite familiar, namely, one more of the
          Evangelistic firms already cursing society, and interfering with
          the regular clergy business. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Scriptural details are as follows: The <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">arab</span></span> filled the houses of the
          Egyptians, they covered the ground, they lighted on the people, the
          land was laid waste on their account. A biting, insidious creature,
          which comes like a dart, with great noise, and, rushing with great
          impetuosity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
          238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          on the skin, sticks to it most tenaciously. They boldly beset
          cattle, and not only obtain ichor, as other flies, but also suck
          out blood from beneath, and occasion great pain.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They have no proboscis, but, instead, have double sets
          of teeth, like wasps, which they infix deeply in the skin; they
          greatly infest the ears of dogs. This genus is most impudently
          pertinacious in its assaults, spares neither man nor beast, gorges
          itself to bursting with blood, infusing an irritating venom at the
          same time. No idea can be formed of their obstinate rapacity. It is
          in vain to drive them away; they return again in the self-same
          moment, and their perseverance wearies out the most patient
          spirit.”</span> (McC.) These flies, flying a short distance into
          the heavens, do their work around the dunghill of human tradition,
          but the collections of one of them recently amounted to $400,000 in
          eight American cities, so the business can be made a money maker by
          those willing to cater to the demand for sensationalism, and who
          have no hesitancy in repeating ancient blasphemies against God's
          holy name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These flies are
          called dog-flies, because they infest the ears of dogs; and when it
          is remembered that the Scriptures refer to the clergy as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“dumb dogs”</span> (Isa. 56:10, 11; Phil.
          3:2) we can readily see the application. The clergy of an entire
          city will sit on a platform, facing virtually the whole population,
          and hear themselves called liars, hypocrites, false-alarms and
          other villainous names. But because they hope to get a few
          <span class="tei tei-q">“converts,”</span> and therefore a few
          shekels for the <span class="tei tei-q">“sanctuary,”</span> they
          will take it all meekly, and prefer to take it rather than humbly
          admit one item of truth in all Pastor Russell's beautiful writings.
          After the firm has left town, they frequently bemoan the treatment
          received and think longingly of the wherewithal taken by the fly
          that was not satisfied with mere ichor, but wanted the real
          blood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point it
          may be well to explain the plagues of frogs and lice. The former
          seems to represent the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Old Theology Quarterly</span></span> which
          Pharaoh found everywhere contaminating his kingdom, but which, at
          the hand of the Lord, suddenly died out completely. The latter
          seems to represent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">The Bible Students Monthly</span></span>.
          There is no record that the plague of lice was discontinued, and
          even yet the Egyptians (people of the world) and Pharaoh (the
          Devil) and his magicians (the clergy) scratch their heads many a
          time, wondering how to deal with a plague which they cannot
          duplicate.</p>

          to putrefy or corrupt. Thus it seemed to worshipers of the beast
          and his image that anybody that would accept the teachings of
          Volume II would be in a hopeless condition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          surely go to hell to be tormented forever. An <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“evangelist”</span> who held these views called at the
          home of a lady in Scranton. Entering the hall he saw an elegant
          picture of Pastor Russell. Instantly he lost control of what mind
          he had and vehemently said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I called here
          as a Christian minister, but I see you have old Russell's picture
          here. Are you a follower of his?”</span> The lady replied that she
          was. He then said, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is in hell, and you
          will be there too, if you follow him.”</span> Quick as thought the
          lady reopened the door through which he had just entered, invited
          him to the porch overlooking the valley; and as he stood there
          gazing into space she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell it to the
          atmosphere,”</span> and left him while she attended to more
          important duties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another picture
          of the effect of Volume II on the anti-typical Egyptians may be
          seen from the plague of the murrain (Ex. 9:1-7.) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This consisted in some distemper that resulted in a
          sudden and dreadful mortality among the cattle in the field,
          including horses, asses, camels, oxen and sheep. It was, however,
          confined to the Egyptian cattle, and to those that were in the
          field; for though the cattle of the Hebrews breathed the same air,
          drank the same water, and fed in the same pastures, not a creature
          of theirs died. The Egyptian cattle that survived in the sheds, and
          were afterwards sent into the fields, were destroyed by the
          succeeding storm of fire and hail.”</span> (McC.) These creatures
          were valuable to the Egyptians. They used them for bearing their
          burdens, for sacrifices and for food. They represent the classes
          that go to make up the nominal church and support it. Thus it
          seemed to the worshippers of the Beast and his Image that the only
          way to prevent the loss of all their live stock would be to keep
          them securely impounded, allowing them no liberty whatever.</p>

          how Volume III appears to the worshipers of the beast and his image
          is shown by the plague of boils described in Ex. 9:8-12.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The boil was a scab or pustule, which
          might or might not break out into an ulcerous sore (Lev. 13:18).
          With this, in one of its worst forms, Job was afflicted (2:7), and
          by this Hezekiah was brought to the verge of the grave. (2 Kings
          20:7; Isa. 38:21.) It was an eruption of a very painful kind
          accompanied with a burning itch, tending to produce a permanent
          state of foul and wasteful disease. One form of this disease which
          seized upon the legs and knees, and was regarded as incurable, was
          peculiar to Egypt, and was hence called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘the botch of Egypt.’</span> (Deut. 28:27, 35.) In the
          case before us, this eruption had a tendency to break out into
          larger swellings and became probably the disease called
          elephantiasis, a disease said to be peculiar to Egypt, or the black
          leprosy, a disease which also affects cattle.”</span> (McC.) It was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ashes of the furnace,”</span> loyalty to
          the memory of the bullock, the one perfect Sacrifice for all,
          Christ Jesus, that caused the boils; and it is particularly noted
          that the magicians (clergy) could not withstand this plague, the

          how the publication of Volume IV looks to the worshipers of the
          beast and his image is shown in the plague of hail, described in
          Ex. 9:13-26. <span class="tei tei-q">“The character of this and the
          following plagues must be carefully examined, as the warning seems
          to indicate an important turning-point. The ruin caused by the hail
          was evidently far greater than that effected by any of the earlier
          plagues; for it destroyed men, which those others seem not to have
          done, and not only men, but beasts and the produce of the earth. In
          this case Moses, while addressing Pharaoh, openly warns his
          servants how to save something from the calamity. Pharaoh for the
          first time acknowledges his wickedness.”</span> (McC.) The

          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Day of Vengeance,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Battle of Armageddon”</span>, (as it
          is now called) as the latter would appear to the mind of the
          clergy, is self-evident. Your true clergyman has the greatest
          abhorrence for any truth that would tend to lessen men's reverence
          for himself or the systems which he aims to perpetuate.</p>

          spirit of religious depression very unlike the spirit of abounding
          enterprise in business, in manufacturing, in engineering and
          construction. There are about 16,000,000 Catholics in continental
          United States. Now, in our immigration for ninety years back, no
          less than 15,000,000 were Catholics. If all remained loyal to its
          tenets they would number 45,000,000 now instead of 16,000,000. The
          Protestants have lost ground, too, when the filling up of the
          country is counted. Our own denomination, the Baptists, reflects
          the general trend. The increase among the Baptists of America has
          been equal to only one-fourth of the birth rate among us, proving

          these Satan has placed three great untruths, human immortality, the
          Antichrist and a certain delusion which is best described as race
          hatred—in reality murder, the spirit of the very Devil. (1 John
          3:15.) It is this last and crowning feature of Satan's work that is
          mentioned first. The other two errors are the direct cause of this
          one. The wars of the Old Testament were all intended to illustrate
          the battlings of the New Creature against the weaknesses of the
          flesh, and are not in any sense of the word justification for the
          human butchery practiced during the Christian era in the name of
          religion, exemplified by the events of St. Bartholomew's Day and by
          the wicked Inquisition. Nowhere in the New Testament is hatred of
          other peoples encouraged. Everywhere and always it is forbidden;
          and yet, under one guise or another it has been encouraged for
          centuries by the clergy class who should have been teaching the
          people the message given them by the Prince of Peace.</p>

          Millions of people are being turned away from faith in a God of
          Love and from faith in the Bible as His Message by the most
          monstrous blasphemies of the Dark Ages. I charge the responsibility
          of all this against the sects and creeds of Christendom. I charge
          that the ministers, whose eyes are now open to a saner

          and, instead of helping them out of the darkness, are now leading

          everything contrary to the Word of God. God is still misrepresented
          in the world. The creeds of the Dark Ages are still hugged to the
          bosom in outward pretense, while inwardly they are loathed. A great
          fraud, a great hypocrisy, you say? I answer, Yes; the most
          astounding the world has ever known. Two hundred thousand professed
          ministers of God and of Christ are standing before the world today
          telling the legends of the Dark Ages and seeking to hinder the
          people from coming to a knowledge of the Truth, meanwhile receiving
          the people's money and reverence. Does not such hypocrisy, such
          blasphemy against God, such deception of the people, such keeping

          Thes. 2:10, 11.) In each case the Greek gives the definite article.
          The frog issuing from the false prophet (the image of the beast) is
          the doctrine of human immortality. These deluded souls actually
          believe this error, and will be able to prove it to the
          satisfaction of the dragon, without a doubt. This error lies at the
          bottom of the doctrines of eternal torment and of the trinity.
          There is a hint in 1 John 4:1-3 that the cardinal error on which
          the false prophet will insist is that when Jesus came from the
          Father He was more than flesh, i. e., had at least an immortal
          soul.—Rev. 13:11, 13, 14, 15; 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:10;

          our Lord, as St. John does. (Rev. 1:1.) Therefore we are not
          responsible for the symbolism used in that book. There are so many
          ways in which one might be misunderstood, even by good Christian
          people, that we naturally feel a delicacy about expressing our
          views. As we proceed to set forth our understanding of the symbols
          of the Revelation, we wish to state most emphatically that we are
          saying nothing whatever against godly Christians anywhere, at any
          time, whether in any church or out of any church. We have nothing
          to say respecting people. We discuss PRINCIPLES, DOCTRINES, ALWAYS;
          individuals, NEVER! God has not commissioned us to discuss

          represent a government. In Daniel's prophecy the great universal
          empires of the earth are thus symbolized. Babylon was the Lion,
          Medo-Persia the Bear, Greece the Leopard, and <em class=

          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Empire still persists. The Dragon, then, symbolizes the Roman
          power, represented by the civil power in the world. The Beast is
          the Papal system of government. The third symbol, the False
          Prophet, remains to be interpreted. This, we believe, is another
          name for the system elsewhere called <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
          Image of the Beast.’</span> (Rev. 13:14.) According to the
          Scriptures, this Image is a very exact representation of the Beast.
          The False Prophet, or Image of the Beast, we understand to mean the
          Protestant Federation of Churches.</span></p>

          the spirit is a doctrine—an unclean doctrine—a false doctrine. Each
          of these systems will utter the same things, and these utterances

          the Battle of Armageddon.</span></p>

          very forceful, and there is always a close resemblance between the
          symbol itself and the thing symbolized. When the Holy Spirit uses a
          frog to represent certain doctrines or teachings, we may be sure
          that the application will fit well. While a frog is a small
          creature, yet it puffs itself up until it almost bursts with the
          effort to be somebody. A frog has a very wise look, even though it
          does not know very much. Then a frog <em class=

          continual croaking. Applying these characteristics to the picture
          given in the Divine Word, we learn that from kingly power, from the
          Catholic Church and from the Federation of Protestant Churches,
          will go forth the same teachings. The spirit of all will be
          boastful; an air of superior knowledge and wisdom will be assumed;
          all will foretell dire results to follow any failure to obey their
          counsels. However conflicting the creeds, the differences will be
          ignored in the general proposition that nothing ancient must be

          as everything vile, at the mouths of the frogs, croaking from
          pulpits and platforms, and through the religious and secular press.
          The nobler sentiments of some will be strangled by the philosophy
          of the same evil spirit which spoke through Caiaphas, the high
          priest, respecting our Lord Jesus. As Caiaphas declared it
          expedient to commit a crime in violation of justice, both human and
          Divine, to be rid of Jesus and His teachings, so this frog-like
          spirit will approve of any and every violation of principle
          necessary to self-protection.</span></p>

          all bad, but rather that they are doctrines of bombast and
          pomposity, representing themselves to be very wise and great, and
          having the backing of centuries. Out of the mouth of the Dragon

          same principle holds true reversely. As an earthly king does not

          who fights his battles, so the Lord does not vouch for the moral
          character of all who enlist and fight on His side of any question.
          His servants they are to whom they render service, whatever the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          the battle. Anarchists, Socialists, and hot-headed radicals of

          realize truly that the worst form of government is better than

          evil, for the placing of monopolies and utilities and the supplies
          of nature in the hands of people for the public good. The crisis
          will be reached when the hitherto upholders of the law shall become
          violators of the law and resisters of the will of the majority as

          "tei tei-q">“The claims of apostolic succession and clerical
          authority are almost as presumptuously set forth by some of the
          Protestant clergy as by the Papal priesthood. And the right of
          individual private judgment,—the very fundamental principle of the
          protest against Papacy, which led to the Great Reformation,—is now
          almost as strenuously opposed by Protestants as by Papists.
          Protestants seem to have forgotten,—for they truly ignore,—the very
          grounds of the original protest, and, as systems, they are fast
          drifting back toward the open arms of the <span class=

          or supported by almost every sect, is the foundation of the old
          civil system, and has long given authority, dignity and stability
          to the kingdoms of Europe; and the doctrine of the Divine
          appointment and authority of the clergy has hindered God's children
          from progressing in Divine things and bound them by the chains of
          superstition and ignorance to the veneration and adoration of
          fallible fellow-beings, and to their doctrines, traditions and
          interpretations of God's Word. It is this entire order of things
          that is to fall and pass away in the battle of this great day—the
          order of things which for centuries has held the people docile
          under the ruling powers, civil, social and religious. All this has
          been by God's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          and approval, as they claim). But though an evil in itself, it has

          anarchy, which is immeasurably worse, because men were not prepared
          to do better for themselves, and because the time for Christ's

          exposition of the remainder of this chapter was greatly assisted by
          the following letter: <span class="tei tei-q">“Your request for my
          version of what I understood Bro. Russell's expectations to be
          respecting the fulfillment of the 17th Chapter of Revelation
          received and after considerable meditation upon the matter I have
          decided to submit the following: Brother Russell stated that there
          were three possible fulfillments of this Chapter, and that he did
          not or would not go on record as to which would be the correct
          interpretation, for the reason that this Chapter could not be
          interpreted in a positive way until after its fulfillment. He
          stated that this Chapter was the key to all of the pictures, or
          prophecies, of Revelation, which are as yet wrapped in mystery. On
          various occasions I requested Bro. Russell to give me his idea
          respecting the three possible fulfillments; but he remained
          absolutely mum respecting two of the ways, but freely expressed his
          opinion respecting the third way, which he believed would be the
          way in which the prophecy would be fulfilled. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘The beast that thou sawest was, and is not and shall
          ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition,’</span> we
          understand to be the Holy Roman Empire—Church and State, united in
          power from 799 to 1799. The term <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou
          sawest’</span> refers to the thousand-year reign of the Pope, and
          the term <span class="tei tei-q">‘And is not’</span> refers to the
          present non-existence of the Empire in power, and the term
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘And shall ascend from the bottomless pit
          and again go into perdition’</span> refers to the re-establishment
          of the Holy Roman Empire in power and its subsequent destruction.
          The statement <span class="tei tei-q">‘When he cometh, he must
          continue a short space,’</span> was understood by Bro. Russell to
          mean that the beast would rule only for a very short time. In
          answer to a direct question on this point <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Bro. Russell stated that he did not believe
          this short space could be interpreted in days, months, or years,
          but that it simply meant a short time. In the 12th verse, we read
          that <span class="tei tei-q">‘The ten horns which thou sawest are
          ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power
          as kings one hour with the beast.’</span> This seems to set forth
          the Papal view respecting the various kings of Europe which at the
          present time have not received the official anointing by the Pope,
          and consequently have not as yet received their kingdom. If this is
          correct, it would then also mean that if the Pope should anoint
          these kings and declare them to be ruling by Divine right, they
          thereby would officially receive power as kings, and would rule
          with the Pope and together with the Pope would constitute the beast
          again in power.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bro. Russell was anxiously awaiting the settlement of
          the present world war for the reason that it seemed very probable
          that the Pope would be the leading figure in bringing about its
          settlement, and possibly the very basis of the settlement will be
          the recognition of the Pope as the Holy See. If the Pope receives
          such recognition, he could in return immediately grant an official
          anointing of the rulers of the various governments included in the
          settlement, and they then as stated in Verse 13, will be
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Of one mind and shall give their power and
          strength unto the beast.’</span> If this is to be the fulfillment
          of this picture, then it will only be a question of time until
          these same governments will turn upon the Roman Church and
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shall make her desolate and naked, and
          shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire.’</span> (Rev. 17:16.)
          The foregoing briefly outlines what Bro. Russell seemed to think
          would be the outcome of the present war. He had certain articles in
          prospect which, if backed up by fulfilled prophecies, were to be
          the absolute and irrevocable proof to the world of all of the
          leading pictures given in the entire book of Revelation.
          Personally, I think everything seems to be shaping itself towards
          the fulfillment of the Chapter on the line above specified. If you
          are making any use of this letter, kindly specify or emphasize the
          fact that Bro. Russell considered the matter largely as a
          speculation, and that he positively stated that he would not go on
          record in the matter for the reason that when he treated the matter
          he would do so in the light of fulfilled prophecy <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as the last word and
          as the unsealing of the entire book</span></span>, and that he
          would not attempt to do this until such a time as the
          interpretation could not be refuted.”</span> That time has
          evidently now come.</p>

          Palmieri of the Library of Congress, a recognized writer on
          ecclesiastical subjects, announce that Pope Benedict XV is about to
          appoint a commission of four cardinals to renew a movement begun by
          Pope Leo XIII, and abandoned by Pope Pius X, looking to a reunion
          of Christianity and the cultivation of friendly relations with the
          Anglican Church. A public announcement on the subject from Rome is
          expected soon. Dr. Palmieri said that the new movement, as outlined
          in his advices, will be directed particularly toward an
          establishment of the reunion of the Russian church and the Papacy
          and to a thorough re-examination into the validity of Anglican or
          Episcopal ordinations, which was settled in the negative in a papal
          bull <span class="tei tei-q">‘Apostolica Sedis,’</span> by Pope Leo
          X. The interest of the Pope in the problem of Christian unity is
          said to have been intensified by the recent progress of the world
          congress, initiated by the American Episcopal Church.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘The new Pope,’</span> said
          Dr. Palmieri, summarizing the information received from Rome,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘has taken a considerable part in the
          efforts of neutral nations to establish peace among nations. The
          Vatican's efforts have been suggested not only by a humanitarian
          spirit, but by a longing for Christian unity and to end the
          conflict which long since has divided Christian churches. Efforts
          of Leo XIII for carrying out the reunion of Christianity were
          abruptly stopped by Piux X, who aimed at an inner reform of the
          Catholic clergy and turned all his energies to the crushing of
          modernism [Higher Criticism and Evolution]. Benedict XV thinks it
          is time to renew the policy of Leo XIII, also that a
          re-establishment of a political peace would be the first step
          toward renewed attempts to stop the splitting of Christianity into
          a greater number of sects. It seems to the Vatican that the
          Orthodox Slavs will be very soon called to take a more active part
          in the life of western nations, either Protestant or Catholic, and
          that it is necessary to come to an understanding with them to avoid
          evils produced by religious intolerance. The newly planned
          commission of cardinals will pay attention to yearnings for unity,
          which from time to time manifest themselves in the Orthodox church,
          and to cultivate friendly relations with the Anglican church. One
          of the most important tasks of the new commission will be a
          thorough re-examination of the arguments pro and con on the
          validity of Anglican <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg
          266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          ordinations. The bull Apostolica Sedis by Leo X has settled in the
          negative the problem of that validity, but generally theological
          schools assume a more favorable attitude toward acknowledgment the
          validity of Anglican orders, and the new commission of cardinals
          will carefully ponder the reasons set forth by Russian and Anglican
          divines against the decision of Pope Leo X. The friendship of the
          Anglican church is appreciated by Rome, for she may be as a link of
          union between Roman Catholicism and Russian
          Orthodoxy.’</span> ”</span> (Z. '17-52.) We assume that the
          foregoing plan of the pope will succeed. <span class=

          will regain its temporal sovereignty, because it is useful and
          convenient to the Church. It gives the head executive of the church
          a fuller liberty and a fuller sway. The Pope can be no king's
          subject long. It is not in keeping with the divine office to be so.
          It cramps him and narrows his influence for good. Europe has
          acknowledged this influence, and will be forced to bow to it in
          greater times of need than this. Social upheavals, and the red hand
          of anarchy, will yet crown Leo or his successor with the reality of
          power which the third circle symbolizes, and which was once
          recognized universally.’</span> Yes, as the day of trouble draws
          on, ecclesiasticism will endeavor to use its power and influence
          more and more to secure its own political welfare, by its control
          of the turbulent elements of society; but in the crisis of the near
          future the lawless element will spurn all conservative influence
          and break over all restraints, the red hand of Anarchy will do its
          dreadful work, and Babylon, political and ecclesiastical, shall
          fall.”</span>—D. 38.</p>

          no liberty, except the privilege of giving money. The bishops

          Methodist system of blindly following leaders is clear from the
          following extract from the works of a traveller: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“While sojourning in Syria I was told that the whole
          country round Mt. Lebanon was dismayed one year by the news that a
          vast army of marching locusts was coming from the eastern desert.
          The governor of the district ordered a regiment of soldiers to aid
          the people to construct a great rampart of heath bushes to be set
          on fire as the locusts came up to it, hoping thus to save the
          gardens of Beyrout. These locusts always hopped straight ahead,
          deviating neither to the right nor left, and on coming to a house
          went up its stone walls, over it and down it, as if it were a level
          place, and in such inconceivable numbers that an American resident
          described the noise of the great host passing over the roof as like
          to that of a tremendous hailstorm. At every green leaf on the way
          each took a bite, and then went on for the next one to take his
          bite, until in an incredibly short time not a green thing could be
          seen. When they reached the prepared heaps of heath, and these were
          set on fire, the locusts marched on without pausing, until in a
          brief time they put the bonfires completely out. As the sea was not
          far off everybody hoped that they would take to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> surf bathing. And so they did. Just as
          certain injurious political crowds among us can always be always
          depended upon to march up to the polls and vote the straight
          ticket, when the vanguard reached the waves, like all good true
          locusts, in they hopped, followed by all the rest, till the billows
          seemed to roll only grasshoppers; nor did the scene end until the
          last of the rear guard had skipped over the heaps of his dead
          comrades to make his last jump into the blue waters of the
          Mediterranean.”</span>—Jer. 51:64.</p>

          plotter and schemer who uses a superhuman intelligence and, so far
          as permitted, superhuman powers, in opposing righteousness and
          truth and those who are of the Truth. The inspired record asserts,
          persistently and consistently, that Satan began the rebellion
          against the divine law, and seduced our first parents into
          disobedience, through his own ambition for power; and that since
          man's fall this same Adversary has been the implacable opponent of
          God, of righteousness and of truth; and not only the ensnarer of
          mankind, but the opposer of the great Plan of Atonement which God
          devised and is prosecuting through Christ. From the Scriptural
          account it does not appear that Satan had any sympathizers or
          associate conspirators amongst the angels at the time of his
          secession and attempt to establish a lordship or dominion of his

          knowledge of the Truth. Why does He will this? To the intent that
          having a clear knowledge of the Truth they may make the very best
          possible use of the new trial for life secured for them by their
          Redeemer's Ransom-sacrifice. It is for the carrying out of this,
          God's will, that the Redeemer will inaugurate His Millennial

          Reign, the Millennium, promised in Scripture to follow Christ's
          Second Advent, began in the year 800 A. D., under Pope Leo III.,
          who claimed to be the representative of Christ, His vice-gerent, to
          begin Christ's Reign in His stead. In that year the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Papal states’</span> were ceded to the Church by
          Emperor Charlemagne. Their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Millennium’</span> ended, it was claimed, in the year
          1799, when Napoleon confiscated the territories granted to the
          Church and took the Pope, Pius VI., a captive to France, where he
          died. The succeeding freedom from Papal persecution, and the
          widespread circulation of the Bible in the languages of the people,
          was declared by the Papal leaders to be the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘little season’</span> (Rev. 20:3) to follow the
          thousand-year Reign of Christ on earth; and they are hoping that
          soon they will regain their former power and prestige and once more
          reign supreme, and that their rule will be permanent. This Papal
          Millennium is known in history as the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Dark
          Ages.’</span> During those dark centuries millions were tortured,
          exiled and murdered for refusing to bow to the mandates of the
          apostate Church, under the leadership of Popes, Bishops and
          priests. Agents and spies were employed to apprehend and bring to
          punishment any who were found to express sentiments contrary to the
          Papal hierarchy, or who failed to bow in abject submission to their
          authority. Thus were the nations of Europe paganized, and steeped
          in error and superstition and in reverence for men who falsely
          claimed to be the special and authorized representatives of God on
          earth. They presumed to have authority to alter the Laws of God
          when it seemed advisable to them to do so, and <span class=

          Jewish theology, as collected from the Talmud, Messiah is to gather
          in from the Dispersion all the scattered descendants of the Tribes,
          to discomfit their foreign oppressors, and from Jerusalem as a
          centre to rule over the whole earth which is to be a scene of

          Ancient Worthies, who were faithful during the reign of evil, even
          unto death, will have some further honorable service, not only
          during the Millennial Age, but subsequently. For various reasons,
          therefore, we rank them higher in honor than the Great
          Company.”</span> (Z. '04-313.) <span class="tei tei-q">“These
          Ancient Worthies will be unlike the remainder of mankind, not alone
          in the fact that their trial is past while the trial of the world
          in general will just be beginning; but they will be unlike them
          also in the fact that they will have attained the reward of their
          faithfulness—they will be perfect men. When Abraham, Isaac, Jacob
          and all the Ancient Worthies have been resurrected, and shall
          appear amongst the regathered Israelites, their perfect minds will
          quickly grasp present-day knowledge and inventions. (John 7:15.)
          And as Jesus taught the people positively, definitely, clearly, and
          not doubtfully and in a confused way, as did the scribes, so it
          will be with the perfected Ancient Worthies, when they appear
          amongst men.”</span>—D. 625.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Isa. 11:10 points us to the Millennial Day, and
          another root of Jesse, as connected with the blessing of the
          Gentiles. This latter seed seems to be referred to also in Heb.
          11:39, 40. The Ancient Worthies shall not only be the princes, the
          representatives of the spiritual, invisible Kingdom, but also grand
          ensigns or standards set up before mankind, as illustrations of
          what all mankind may attain unto.”</span> (Z. '98-312.)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The painful experiences of the Ancient
          Worthies during the Jewish age will be a store of blessings,
          instruction and help, by which they, when made subordinate
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘princes’</span> in the Kingdom, will
          assist in the restitution work.”</span> (T. 111.) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“While the Worthies are not in any sense part of the
          Sin-Offering, they are nevertheless connected with the cleansing
          from sin: their ashes (the knowledge and remembrance of their
          faithfulness unto death), mingled with the water of Truth, and
          applied with the purgative, cleansing hyssop, is valuable,
          purifying, sanctifying.”</span> (T. 108.) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The service which the Ancient Worthies will be given
          will be more than God would ordinarily entrust to a perfect human
          being. It will be a part of this service to deal with the
          imperfect, fallen creatures and to help them up out of sin and
          imperfection. While in one sense of the word this work is
          desirable, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          yet it is not what a perfect human being would prefer. These
          Ancient Worthies will come forth from the tomb perfect; but during
          the entire Millennium they will be amidst imperfect
          surroundings.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A part of the evidence that the Ancient Worthies will
          be made sharers of the spirit nature and become members of the
          Great Company class is built upon the fact that they seem to be
          represented typically by the tribe of Levi. The fact that this
          tribe had no inheritance in the land seems to imply that the
          Ancient Worthies will have no earthly inheritance. Since the
          Heavenly Father has been pleased to arrange for the Great Company a
          place on the spirit plane, and since He is operating according to
          some general principles of righteousness, we are inclined to think
          that He may have something more for the Ancient Worthies than will
          come to the remainder of mankind. When Abraham was called upon to
          offer up his son Isaac, he exhibited a degree of loyalty greater
          than the Great Company will be called upon to manifest.
          Furthermore, in Gen. 17:8, God said unto Abraham, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee,
          the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
          an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.’</span> Two
          thousand years later, St. Stephen said that God never gave Abraham
          so much as a foot of the promised land (Acts 7:6); but he implied
          that Abraham will yet receive that land and afterward leave it to
          his posterity. If the land is to be given to Abraham and his
          coadjutors, and then to be left to his seed and mankind in general,
          the thought would seem to be implied that the Ancient Worthies will
          pass to the spirit nature.”</span>—Z. '13-52.</p>

          comparison with the stars in the firmament. The crystals form into
          units having twelve equal sides. The blue is the color of
          faithfulness; the gold shows the faithfulness towards God; the
          star-like appearance shows the faithfulness towards all the
          Heavenly beings—angels, archangels, and the Great Company; the
          crystalline formation shows the faithfulness towards the symbolical
          and actual twelve tribes of Israel which, in the last analysis,
          include all who shall become heirs of salvation. Those who gain the
          prize of the High Calling can be trusted.—1 Cor. 4:2; Luke

          five equal sides and angles. The Church's obedience is perfect
          towards God as indicated in the faces of the crystals, five being a
          symbol of Divinity. It is operative towards the brethren as in the
          twelve-faced crystals, and towards both phases of the Kingdom, as
          in the twenty-four-sided crystals.</p>

          to the diamond in hardness; a beautiful blue stone. Many of the

          in a colorless stone; but by skillful cutting the deep-colored
          portion may be caused to impart color to the entire gem. This stone
          crystallizes in the most beautiful and wonderful pattern
          conceivable, consisting of a six-sided pyramid at either end,
          separated by three different sets of surfaces of six each and two
          different sets of surfaces of three each. We may think of the two
          ends as representing the teachings of the Twelve Apostles, and the
          twenty-four surfaces between as representing the twenty-four elders
          (prophecies pertaining to the Kingdom of God). God is unchangeable;
          although the different operations of His Plan, in different ages,
          make Him seem changeable to mankind. But the perfected Plan will be
          the adoration of all His creatures. This gem also shows how God can
          take characters whose conduct may have been very irregular, and by
          skillful cutting make them copies of Himself.</p>

          would not intoxicate. It crystallizes in double pyramids (base to
          base) of three sides on each pyramid. Amethyst was Pastor Russell's
          birth-stone; and behold how perfect its application! He was true
          blue in his faithfulness, and fully loyal to the blood of Christ,

          draughts from the Fountain of all Truth, our Father's Word. The

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          William Miller's dream, as given in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Three
          Worlds</span></span>, the first of Pastor Russell's books, long
          since out of print, where it is told only as a dream. (Jer. 23:28.)
          It calls to mind a dream of Pastor Russell's, often told in
          private. In his early youth he dreamed of sleeping in an attic.
          Suddenly he awoke to see the morning sun, just emerged over the
          hill-top, blazing directly in his face. He jumped to his feet with
          a start, thinking that it must be late. In doing so he stumbled
          over several forms still asleep. He was about to reproach himself
          for thus rudely awakening them, when he discovered that not one of
          the sleepers had been disturbed. The application is evident.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The light shineth in darkness, and the
          darkness comprehendeth it not.”</span> Pastor Russell was awakened
          by the light of the Sun of the New Day. He tried to waken others,
          and succeeded with <span class="tei tei-q">“just one here, one
          there;”</span> but the great mass are still asleep. However, the
          Dawn comes on apace. Now for William Miller's dream:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I dreamed that God, by an unseen hand, had sent me a
          curiously wrought casket, about ten inches long by six square, made
          of ebony and pearls curiously inlaid. To the casket there was a key
          attached. I immediately took the key and opened the casket, when,
          to my wonder and surprise, I found it filled with all sorts and
          sizes of jewels—diamonds, precious stones—and gold and silver coin
          of every dimension and value, beautifully arranged in their several
          places in the casket; and thus arranged, they reflected a light and
          glory equalled only by the sun. [These jewels are the beautiful
          truths which the open casket unfolded to his sight.] I thought it
          was my duty not to enjoy this wonderful sight alone, although my
          heart was overjoyed at the brilliancy, beauty and value of its
          contents. I therefore placed it on a center-table in my room, and
          gave out the word that all who had a desire might come and see the
          most glorious and brilliant sight ever seen by man in this life.
          The people began to come in, at first few in number, but increasing
          to a crowd. When they first looked into the casket, they would
          wonder and shout for joy. But when the spectators increased, every
          one would begin to trouble the jewels, taking them out of the
          casket and scattering them on the table.</span></p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I began to think that the owner would require the
          casket and jewels again at my hand; and that if I suffered them to
          be scattered, I could never place them in their places in the
          casket again as before, and felt I should never be able to meet the
          accountability; for it would be immense. I then began to plead with
          the people not to handle them, nor take them out of the casket. But
          the more I pleaded, the more they scattered; and now they seemed to
          scatter them all over the room, on the floor, and every piece of
          furniture in the room. I then saw that among the genuine jewels and
          coin they had scattered an innumerable quantity of spurious jewels
          and counterfeit coin. I was highly incensed at their base conduct
          and ingratitude, and reproved and reproached them for it; but the
          more I reproved, the more they scattered the spurious jewels and
          false coin among the genuine. I then became vexed in my very soul,
          and began to use physical force to push them out of the room; but
          while I was pushing out one, three more would enter, and bring in
          dirt, shavings, sand, and all manner of rubbish, until they had
          covered every one of the true jewels, diamonds and coins from
          sight. They also tore into pieces my casket and scattered it among
          the rubbish. I thought that no man regarded my sorrow or my anger.
          I became wholly discouraged and disheartened, and sat down and
          wept. [When the 1844 time passed, how perfectly was this
          fullfilled.] While I was thus weeping and mourning for my great
          loss and accountability, I remembered God, and earnestly prayed
          that He would send me help.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Immediately the door opened and a man entered the
          room, when the other people all left it. Then he, having a dirt
          brush in his hand, opened the windows and began to brush the dust
          and rubbish from the room. I cried to him to forbear; that there
          were some precious jewels scattered among the rubbish. But he told
          me to fear not, for he would take care of them. Then while he
          brushed the dust and rubbish, the false jewels and counterfeit
          coin, all rose and went out of the window like a cloud and the wind
          carried them away. In the bustle I closed my eyes for a moment.
          When I opened them the rubbish was all gone, and the precious
          jewels, the diamonds, the gold and the silver coins lay scattered
          in profusion all over the room. He then placed on the table a
          casket, much larger and more beautiful than the former, and
          gathered up the jewels, the diamonds, the coins, by the handful,
          and cast them into the casket, till not one was left, although some
          of the diamonds were not bigger than the point of a pin. He then
          called upon me to come and see. I looked into <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the casket, but my eyes were dazzled
          with the sight. The contents shone with ten times their former
          glory. I thought that they had been scoured in the sand by the feet
          of those wicked persons who had scattered and trod them in the
          dust. They were arranged in beautiful order in the casket—every one
          in its place—without any visible pains on the part of the man
          [Pastor Russell] who cast them in. I shouted for joy; and that
          shout awoke me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">21:21.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          the twelve gates were [twelve] pearls; every several gate was of
          one pearl.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The peculiar
          lustre of a pearl is dependent on the fact that the surface is not
          perfectly smooth, but covered with the irregularly sinuous edges of
          innumerable layers of inconceivable thinness, deposited one over
          the other. The distance of these edges from each other varies
          indefinitely, the pearls of the finest water having them closest.
          They are always, however, too fine to be detected by the naked eye.
          The edges make so many steps, so to speak; and the iridescence is
          produced by the mutual interference of the rays of light reflected
          from these thousands of angles. For their water, or lustre, as
          distinguished from iridescence, pearls are indebted to their being
          composed of thin layers, which allow light to pass through them,
          while their numerous surfaces disperse and reflect the light in
          such a manner that it returns and mingles with that which is
          directly reflected from the exterior. The thinner and more
          transparent the constituent layers, the more perfect is the lustre.
          The immediate occasion of the production of a pearl appears to be
          always the presence of some extraneous substance inside of the
          shell of the mollusk.”</span> (McC.) The mollusk is the earthly
          tabernacle; the extraneous substance is the New Mind. The
          successive layers are the additions made to it, <span class=

          of Death (Psa. 23:4); but the Prophets encouraged us to hope for a
          watchman who would tell us of the coming of the Day. (Isa. 21:12.)
          In the Apostle's time he declared the night was far spent, being
          then more than two-thirds gone. (Rom. 13:12.) The event that is to
          bring in the Day is the rising of the Sun of Righteousness. (Mal.
          4:2.) When here at the First Advent Christ was the light of the
          world (John 8:12); and the people in His immediate neighborhood saw
          a great Light, shadowing forth His coming glory. (Isa. 9:2.) He

          quietly, like a thief. (1 Thes. 5:1.) When the Morning comes, the
          first work is banishing the works of the night. (Ezek. 7:7-12.)
          Next comes the opening of the spiritually blind eyes of those that
          have physical sight. (Amos 5:18.) Surely, the best time for a great
          oculist to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg

          open the eyes of the blind is in the day time. (Isa. 35:5.) Now
          matters are more or less obscured (1 Cor. 13:12); but the time is
          coming when the blind shall be shown a way of life they have not
          hitherto known. (Isa. 42:16.) Will the Lord show wonders in the
          dark? (Psa. 88:10.) He will indeed; and when the nations come forth
          from the tomb, they will seek Him that turneth the shadow of death
          into the morning. (Amos 5:8; Isa. 42: 6, 7.) They will seek Him and
          will find Him. No wonder, then, that the Psalmist, looking down the
          stream of time to that happy Day, exultingly exclaims, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then [after full experience with sin and death] they
          cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He saved them out of

          death, and brake their bands in sunder. Oh, that men would praise
          the Lord for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the
          children of men! For He hath broken the gates of brass [that stood
          between them and perfection], and cut the bars of iron asunder
          [that held them in death's prison house].”</span> (Psa. 107:13-16.)

          companions of the Christ. (Ex. 12:8; Heb. 2:17; Rom. 5:3; Col.
          1:11.) Do not think it strange. (James 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12;
          5:10.) When you get the right viewpoint, you will rejoice in your
          sufferings. (Deut. 13:3; Psa. 23:4; 119:67.) The trials will not
          last forever (Psa. 39:1); and in them all you may hear the songs of
          deliverance. (Psa. 32:6, 7.) There is nothing to turn back to (Heb.

          it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the
          fifth day of the month, at I was among the captives by the river of
          Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of
          God.</span></span>—Christ promised that at His Second Advent He
          would raise up a <span class="tei tei-q">“faithful and wise
          servant,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“steward,”</span> who
          should watch and give forth in due season meat for the Household of
          Faith. This one should be given charge of all the Storehouse, the
          Word of God, to bring out of it things new and old. (Matt.
          24:44-47; Luke 12:42-44.) The Prophet Ezekiel types this servant.
          As Ezekiel was among the Lord's people, the Hebrews, in captivity
          in literal Babylon, this servant was among those in captivity in
          Mystic Babylon, beside the great river Chebar (<span class=

          the nations, on which Christendom is founded, and from which she
          draws her support, as did in a literal sense Babylon from her great
          river, Euphrates. In the early seventies Charles Taze Russell found
          himself engaged in commerce, but earnestly studying the Word of
          God, and striving to teach what he found therein. In fulfilment of
          the Divine promise the Heavenly things were opened to him (Matt.
          3:16), and he saw the significance of the visions, prophecies,
          given in olden times by the Almighty. He was given a crystal-clear
          understanding of the character of Jehovah.</p>

          the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
          Jehoiachin's captivity, the Word of the Lord came expressly unto
          Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans
          by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was there upon
          him.</span></span>—Men do not raise themselves up to become great
          and honored agents in God's outworking of the Divine Plan of the
          Ages (Luke 18:14; Eph. 3:11); but now and then throughout the
          centuries Jehovah Himself (1 Cor. 12:18) has raised up Christian
          men to carry forward one step or another of His purposes. God made
          special use of St Paul, St John, Arius, Peter Waldo, John Wycliffe,
          Martin Luther and Charles T. Russell. The significance of the word
          Ezekiel is <span class="tei tei-q">“God is <span class="tei tei-pb"

          the message of Pastor Russell. He shows the power of Jehovah to
          save His people now (Acts 15:14), and later to save all the willing
          and obedient of mankind. (Acts 15:17.) As Ezekiel was the son of
          Buzi, <span class="tei tei-q">“Contemned of God,”</span> Pastor
          Russell was born the child of a nominal religious system which is
          unfaithful to Jehovah. Pastor Russell, by the faithful carrying out
          of his vow of consecration to Divine service, was accepted as a
          true priest of the Almighty. He sacrificed himself and all that he
          had until, in October, 1916, he died penniless, but rich in the
          things of God. Chosen expressly by God to declare the message of
          Present Truth to the last, or Laodicean age, of the Church, the
          hand, power, of Jehovah was upon him.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          I looked and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
          cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it;
          and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the
          midst of the fire.</span></span>—As a young man Charles T. Russell
          was looking intently to see what might be discerned in the Word of
          God. <span class="tei tei-q">“Watch,”</span> said the Master.
          Pastor Russell took for his motto, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
          stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to
          see what He will say unto me.”</span> (Hab. 2:1) He called his
          semi-monthly publication, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Watch
          Tower</span></span>”</span>; and, firm in the belief that the
          Second Advent took place in 1874, he included as a sub-title,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“And Herald of Christ's Presence.”</span>
          The north symbolizes the spiritual phase of the Kingdom of God.
          (Isa. 14:13; D. 653.) Pastor Russell beheld coming, permitted by
          God, a great Time of Trouble, a whirlwind of warfare, revolution
          and anarchy. (Jer. 25:32; Psa. 58:9, 10; D. 528.) It was the cloud
          accompanying the approach to human affairs of Him for whose Kingdom
          many have so long prayed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Clouds and
          darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment are the
          habitation of His Throne, a fire goeth before Him and burneth up
          His enemies round about.”</span> (Psa. 97:2) A conflagration,
          beginning with world war, is upon the earth, developing into
          revolution and anarchy. Fire symbolises the last of these
          misfortunes. (Dan. 7:11) The situation is complicated, infolding,
          perplexing. None of the national leaders understand the situation.
          To the poor world, in gross darkness, and lying <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the wicked one,”</span> the cloud is full of
          darkness (Isa. 60:2), of gloominess (Joel 2:2; Zeph. 1:15); but to
          those who are taken out of the world and into Christ, it is full of
          brightness and hope—a white cloud, with a silver lining. In the
          bright light of the dawning Day of Christ the faces of the Lord's
          people light up with joy as they see these things coming to pass;

          deliverance, too, of the whole world from the kingdom of Satan, the
          god of this world (2 Cor. 4:4), into the glorious Kingdom of God,
          the other side of the trouble. With the understanding of God, His
          work, plan and purpose, there shone forth the amber, golden glow of
          the Divine presence, and of the true character, nature and glory of
          the Almighty God of Love. The Father Himself is supervising the
          troublous commotion, bruising to heal (Hos. 6:1), and <span class=

          the golden amber glow of God's presence, came a wonderful
          understanding of something long misunderstood and
          misrepresented—the character of God. As the vision showed
          <span class="tei tei-q">“four living creatures,”</span> so the
          Divine character was seen by the Laodicean steward to consist of
          four active principles (Rev. 3:14); Justice, Power, Love and
          Wisdom. The four have the likeness of a perfect man.</p>

          characteristics or attributes; and each has the Word of God
          (wings—Rev. 12:14), in the Old and New Testament, in two different
          ways of operation (two pairs).</p>

          the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of
          burnished brass.</span></span>—The feet members of Christ,
          embodying the Divine attributes on earth, are righteous (straight)
          in Christ's righteousness, pure, unblemished in God's sight, holy,
          acceptable, living sacrifices (the calf is a type of unblemished
          sacrifice); and they shine with the imputed perfection of the Man
          Christ Jesus.</p>

          by the Word of God is the Divine power (hand) to execute the thing
          purposed, operating through human channels, through the power of
          men. He shows the qualities of the Divine mind through man.
          Shielded, protected, sustained by the Word (wings)—(Psa. 61:4), the

          eagle.</span></span>—The character of Jehovah possesses four
          fundamental attributes, each composed of all the others. The four
          faces or features of the living creatures represent the four
          attributes of God, each inseparable from the others, and in each
          operate each and all of the four. Divine Justice operates in the
          fulness of Power, Love and Wisdom. In the fall of man into sin,
          unbending Justice enforced death for disobedience. Love delayed the
          execution of the sentence upon Adam 930 years (Gen. 5:5), that
          Wisdom might impress upon the erring human son an indelible lesson
          of the exceeding sinfulness of sin (Rom. 7:13) and the extent of
          the penalty, death, that man, by said experience, might
          <span class="tei tei-q">“know evil.”</span> (Gen. 3:5.) Divine
          power will raise man from the dead, that he may learn to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“know good”</span> and experience the
          fulness of the Father's Love and Wisdom. All who are willing and
          obedient, who consecrate fully to God's will, shall enjoy
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pleasures forevermore”</span> (Psa. 16:11)
          in the sunshine of Divine favor. The unwilling and disobedient
          shall suffer the full penalty of Justice in the Second Death (Rev.
          21:8), <span class="tei tei-q">“utter destruction”</span> (2 Thes.
          1:9), final and eternal obliteration. (Psa. 37:10.) The face of a
          man symbolizes the quality of Love, in the character image and
          likeness of God (Gen. 1:27), the God of love. (1 John 4:8.) The ox
          represents Power (Rev. 4:7); for no animal is stronger, or more
          patient in the exercise of strength. The majestic lion is God's
          Justice, roaring its message of death, and executing all that
          oppose its voice. (Psa. 89:14.) No other creature is so
          far-sighted, or soars so high as the eagle. The eagle symbolizes
          Wisdom, far-seeing, ordering all the affairs of the Almighty along
          the lines of Justice, Power and Love.</p>

          separate function of God's Word; one pair to fly with, to carry
          forward the Plan in the spirit realm, the powers of the air (Eph.

          operations working together <span class=

          of kingship, for those on any plane who are worthy of that honor,
          etc.—the manifestation of every good character fruit and every good
          purpose for the blessing of all His creatures. (John 15:8; Gal.

          sent to the heathen, but to the Lord's people, the Jews, to
          acquaint them with the First Advent, expose those withholding the
          keys of knowledge (Luke 11:52), and warn of the impending
          destruction of Jerusalem and Judea in A. D. 70 and 73. (Matt. 3:7;
          24:2.) A like work was to be accomplished in Spiritual Israel,

          both those in captivity and those remaining at Jerusalem under
          Zedekiah. His following was almost nothing. But he witnessed
          faithfully, and no Hebrew could say that he had not been cautioned
          of danger and warned of impending catastrophe. Whether the clergy
          and people of Christendom wished to heed Pastor Russell or not,
          they certainly heard his words. (Z. '03-436.) His work was
          peculiarly prospered. Against difficulties it grew and extended
          beyond the wildest dreams, until it compassed the civilized world.
          In the face of the united opposition of Protestant and Romanist

          the theatres, on the bill-boards, in billions of tract pages
          distributed gratis, in millions of home libraries, in the questions
          of inquiring church members, it was evident everywhere that a great
          preacher was faithfully sounding forth a trumpet message. With a
          voice of many waters, reverberating like thunder throughout the
          world, spoke Pastor Russell; and ere long <span class=

          crowned his head, he was never afraid of words nor of angry looks.

          stoned to death,”</span> said a Wilkes-Barre, Pa. <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> preacher, in answer to a kindly
          invitation to come and hear Pastor Russell preach. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He ought to be skinned alive, and his hide stretched
          on a door,”</span> remarked a Chicago <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“divine”</span> to another <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“divine,”</span> coming out from one of Pastor
          Russell's addresses. A scorpion has a great swelling, formidable
          looking head, but it stings with its tail. (Rev. 9:5, 10.)
          Ecclesiasticism is made up of organizations whose heads utter
          boastful, swelling words, but which do injury through their
          followers. The sting of a scorpion—of the followers of synods and
          popes—is through poisoned words. Every great reformer has had some
          turn on him who were very close to him. Not from outside did Pastor
          Russell suffer most. A few from among his own household, whom he
          had befriended, helped, pushed, advanced, struck at him to ruin him
          and destroy his influence and his work. It is characteristic of the
          scorpion to sting and poison in the dark corners of a man's own
          home. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not afraid, though thou dost
          dwell among scorpions.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2:8.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">But
          thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious
          like that rebellious house; open thy mouth, and eat that I give
          thee.</span></span>—The attitude of the rebellious Christian was
          not that of God's chosen servant. Never did he rebel against the
          Divine leading, nor seek to pervert the Word of God. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My flesh is meat (food) indeed.”</span> (Jno. 6:55.)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by

          4:4.) Whatever the word or message that came from the Father's lips
          through the inspired pages of the Bible, the Laodicean steward was
          to appropriate, assimilate.—Rev. 10:9.</p>

          when I looked, behold, a hand was sent unto me; and lo, a roll of a
          book was therein.</span></span>—The Divine hand sent from God is
          the Divine power, support, upholding and advancing the interests of
          whatever is in the hand. <span class="tei tei-q">“The book
          therein”</span> is the Divine Plan of the Ages, Present Truth,
          especially as relating to the impending downfall of Christendom in
          the end of this Age. Ancient books were written on a continuous
          sheet, rolled up. The sheet was often written on both sides. The
          writing outside could be plainly read until covered by the rolling,
          but that inside was entirely hidden from view. Present Truth, the
          Divine Plan of the Ages, contains features which are plain to any
          one who looks at them; such as those relating to the earthly
          features of God's Plan—the evil in the earth, the clashing
          interests of rich and poor, and various other elements of the
          present order of things, the great war, and the approach of a
          better order of things after <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the roll of the book,”</span> also
          contains hidden, deep truths, discernible only to those who have
          the Holy Spirit. It possesses features impossible for natural men,
          not anointed with the Spirit, to perceive. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The natural man perceiveth not the things of the
          Spirit, neither can he know them; for they are spiritually
          discerned.”</span> (1 Cor. 2:14.) Many thousands of consecrated
          Christians are upheld, comforted and rejoiced by the deep things of
          God, made clear for the first time in centuries by the <span class=

          there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and

          Almighty would clearly spread out His purposes,—the honor which
          came to Pastor Russell, and with it a witness work of vast extent
          and responsibility! The purpose of Present Truth is to inform the
          Lord's people and the people of the world, as far as they may
          listen, concerning the significance of the times. All classes
          profit more or less from the warning of Pastor Russell, as the
          message goes broadcast throughout the world. It comes with a
          different significance to Church and to world. To the Church it is
          a trumpet call of truth (Rev. 10:2-7), to get ready quickly for
          deliverance, resurrection glory, honor and immortality. To the
          world, the worldly-minded, the Present Truth is something to be
          dreaded. (Isa. 28:19.) This world, age, state of affairs, is in
          process of destruction. The destroying agencies, as portrayed in
          the Scriptures (1 Kings 19:11, 12; Z. '04-249; Z. '98-207, 208) are
          world-wide war, then revolutions on an unprecedented scale, and
          finally universal anarchy—savagery. The significance of anarchy is
          appreciated by but few. It means an utter absence of government,
          first the paralysis, and ultimately the ceasing, of the
          governmental functions which now afford protection, peace and
          safety to property and life. As matters progress to the climax, as
          disaster after disaster overtakes human effort, and disintegration
          descends into the dissolution of law and order, the whole earth
          will be <span class="tei tei-q">“filled with violence”</span>.
          (Gen. 6:11; Micah 6:12); and men's hearts will utterly fail. (Luke
          21:26.) Picture the worst revolutions ever known; this trouble will
          outdo them all. Paint the darkest picture, and none will be as
          black as the sable pall of this dreadful night, this reign of
          terror already settling down upon mankind. Truly, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“mourning, lamentation and woe”</span> were the burden
          of God's Prophet Ezekiel, as he foresaw the destruction of his
          beloved city, Jerusalem—and of Pastor Russell, as he foreknew the
          desolation of a world!</p>

          Israel.</span></span>—The Prophet was to find something. As Ezekiel
          ate the book in the hand of God, so the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“faithful and wise servant”</span> of this day
          absorbed, assimilated, the Plan of the Ages which was in the power
          (hand) of the Almighty. Pastor Russell searched diligently to find
          all that he could of the purposes of God. As he understood, he was
          to go speak to <span class="tei tei-q">“the House of Sons”</span>
          (Heb. 3:6), all the children, sons of God—to nominal Spiritual
          Israelites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:2.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">So I

          roll.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I never knew any one
          so willing to do the will of God,”</span> said the private
          secretary and traveling companion of Pastor Russell. He was eager
          to learn all he could about the Heavenly Father's will. It was not
          of himself that he learned and taught the Divine Plan; but God
          Himself caused him to learn, believe and teach.</p>

          was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span></span>—No mere
          casual scanning of Present Truth would suffice. The man of God was
          to be filled with the great Message. (Rev. 10:9, 10.) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The sweetest story ever told”</span> (Psa. 19:10;
          119:103) brought inexpressible peace. It sweetened the experiences
          of a life of sacrifice. Whoever eats, assimilates Present Truth,
          finds every heart question answered, every doubt silenced. He
          learns <span class="tei tei-q">“the peace of God that passeth
          understanding”</span> (Phil. 4:7), and a sweetness as of honey in
          the promises, plans, and purposes of the Father of Love.</p>

          days to today all to whom the Spirit gives utterance begin to speak
          (Acts 2:1-18) because constrained to do so, because they
          <span class="tei tei-q">“love to tell the story.”</span> To
          Ezekiel, and to the greatest preacher of modern times, came a
          readiness of speech, when Jehovah Himself gave them His Spirit, and
          commanded to <span class="tei tei-q">“get thee unto the house of

          was not to go to the heathen, the drunkards, unbelievers, but to
          the Christian people of the world, the spiritual House of
          Israel.</p>

          of Present Truth had been sent to the heathen with its glad tidings
          for all, they would have turned from devil worship, to worship the
          true God. (Matt. 11:21, 23.) On two occasions the trumpet sound was
          heard by <span class="tei tei-q">“people of a strange speech and of
          a hard language.”</span> Pastor Russell passed through Japan and
          India on a round-the-world tour. In Japan the people requested that
          he stay. It was the message they had longed for. In India the
          natives heard him gladly. In eastern and southern Africa a believer
          in Present Truth found his way from Nyassa to the Cape, and many
          thousands of natives embraced the Truth and were baptised.</p>

          God. They hear and do not. (Jas. 1:22.) They are forgetful hearers
          of the Word. (Jas. 1:25.) They know their Master's will and do it
          not. (Luke 12:47.) Because they hear not God, they heed not the

          God made him more than equal to it. This last and most illustrious
          of the reformers never asked for money; yet he had enough entrusted
          to him to carry on the work. Champions of Christendom met him on
          the debating platform; each encounter widened and strengthened the
          witness for Present Truth. He faced the modern enemies of
          Reformation with books by tens of millions, and they were unable to
          combat their power. <span class="tei tei-q">“To read the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Studies

          preacher to his flock, <span class="tei tei-q">“is to believe
          them.”</span> No argument could be devised to stem the flood of
          Truth, only a ban on the reading of the books. In innumerable
          places priestcraft caused the public burning of the books.
          Practically every home in America, England, Germany, Sweden,
          Australia, and other Protestant countries was reached by a deluge
          of free tracts. Such a tracting of the world with billions of
          pages, was never known. The enemies of Truth were wholly unable to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name=
          "Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> check the spread of
          knowledge. A further situation faced was the production of the free
          Photo-Drama of Creation, seen and heard by twelve millions. No
          answer could be put forth by clerical foes of truth, but baseless,
          cruel libels on the private life of one of God's noblemen.
          Audiences by the thousands listened to Bible lectures by Pastor
          Russell and by hundreds of public speakers, and their voice is
          still heard all over the world. Stinging assaults of slander were
          ignored by a man of destiny, who had too much of God's work to do
          to pay attention to the yelpings of little men—of the D. D.'s of
          Christendom (Isa. 56:10), who love slumber, but who snarl and bite
          when disturbed in their dreams of <span class="tei tei-q">“peace,
          peace”</span> (Jer. 6:14), social and civic gospels, church unity,
          and evangelistic raids on the pockets of the masses. Not a

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">As
          an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead; fear them
          not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
          rebellious house.</span></span>—The forehead is symbolic of wisdom.
          A man of high forehead, as was Pastor Russell, is of a high type of
          intellect. Pastor Russell's mind was made strong against opponents
          of the Reform which is ushering in the everlasting Kingdom of
          Messiah. It is impossible for error to withstand truth. (Luke
          21:15.) As in apostolic days, believers in Present Truth call
          themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“in the Truth”</span> (2 Pet.
          1:12), the teachings of the Word of God are termed <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Truth”</span> (1 John 3:19), and those who believe
          them are known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Truth people.”</span> (3
          John 4.) The mind of Pastor Russell was filled with Truth. Crystal
          clear, with hard, irresistible logic, the Present Truth, which
          constituted his wisdom and understanding, was the hardest
          proposition ecclesiasticism ever encountered. (Isa. 50:7.) The mind
          of God's steward was as adamant. Adamant is literally, in Hebrew,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a diamond point.”</span> With diamond
          hardness (Rev. 4:3), the Present Truth cuts its way through all
          opposition, though the opposing thought be hard as flint. The
          diamond is the most crystal clear of stones, and represents the
          truth in irresistible form. It is futile to oppose the mind of any
          Present Truth believer, for truth is irrefutable. To those who have
          it, it imparts the mind of an intellectual giant—the mind of
          Christ, of God. (1 Cor. 2:16.) Their foreheads are made as diamond.
          In the light of the sun the diamond sparkles with indescribable
          beauty. It breaks the sunlight up into its component parts and
          reflects and refracts in prismatic flashes of rainbow colors. The
          sun is the Gospel of Divine Love and its embodiment, Jesus Christ.
          The component parts of Christian love are the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> character fruits. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
          long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
          temperance.”</span> (Galatians 5:22-3.) The minds, wisdom,
          characters of God's true people are full of manifestations of the
          shining upon them of the glorious Gospel of the Son of
          Righteousness—full of the beauty of righteousness. The minds of
          God's saints are made as the diamond in its excelling hardness and
          sunlit radiance.</p>

          the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great
          rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His
          place.</span></span>—Through the begetting of the Holy Spirit we
          are raised up to walk in newness of life (Rom. 6:4), to sit with
          Christ in heavenly places (Eph. 2:6), in the Spirit-begotten
          condition. The Spirit raised Pastor Russell up to an understanding
          and appreciation of Heavenly things. (Matt. 3:16.) At Pentecost the
          place where the Apostles were sitting was filled with a rushing
          sound as of a mighty wind, and they received the Holy Spirit (Acts
          2:2.) The mighty rushing sound represented Pastor Russell's
          receiving a rich endowment of the Spirit of God, to whose leadings
          he was fully consecrated and to whose influence and guidance he
          wholly devoted his life. The words of Christ and of God are
          contained in the Bible, written thousands of years ago, behind in
          the stream of time. It was in the Word of God, behind him in time
          (Isa. 30:21), that Pastor Russell perceived the rushing sound, the
          utterances of the Holy Spirit. The message of the Bible has been
          perverted by Catholic and Protestant misunderstandings into
          anything but a glorious and blessed Gospel. It is a thing to be
          dreaded, if the glory of God is to eternally torment the vast
          majority of humans. But the Message of Truth sounded forth by
          Pastor Russell declares the grace of the Gospel which is to reach
          every man, woman and child (1 Tim. 2:6) with its blessed influence,
          power, wisdom and love, so that all creation in due time may join
          in a mighty paeon of praise. <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be
          the glory of Jehovah from His place.”</span>—Psa. 106:48.</p>

          ministers have had glimpses of the Word of God, knowledge of some
          details of the Plan, some measure of the Holy Spirit; but to Pastor
          Russell, God's messenger to the last stage of the Church, was given
          a superabundance of gifts, to set the things of God in order (Isa.
          44:7), to proclaim an harmonious understanding of all the Divine
          purposes for mankind and of some for the angels. (Eph. 3:10.) He
          heard the full harmony of <span class="tei tei-q">“the song of
          Moses and the Lamb.”</span> (Rev. 15:3.) To him the wings (Rev.
          12:14), the Word of God, Old Testament and New, sounded their Glad
          Tidings, a message whose parts <span class="tei tei-q">“touched one
          another,”</span> were in complete touch, full harmony. He heard for
          the first time since Apostolic days the Plan of God, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the noise of the wheels [cycles, ages].”</span> He
          heard the manifestations of the operation of the Holy Spirit, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“noise of a great rushing,”</span> and was
          filled with the Spirit in a measure beyond the portion of most
          Christian men. His patience with the stupid and erring was godlike
          and his love-lit face was an inspiration.</p>

          from earthly aims and raised him up to the plane of sacrificing
          priesthood. He turned from commercial pursuits to devote his life
          to the Heavenly Message. He tasted the bitter herbs of persecution,
          of suffering with Christ; and amid ostracism and persecution he
          lived the life of Christian service. He carried on his work in
          fervency of spirit; for the power of God was upon him,
          strengthening him with might in the inner man (Eph. 3:16), and with
          wisdom to deliver, in the face of the determined opposition of
          priestcraft, the trumpet message announcing the Presence of
          Christ—the sound of the Seventh Trumpet, the trump of God.—Rev.

          will record, as most remarkable, the mental, moral and spiritual
          bondage in which professing Christians were held during the Gospel
          Age, through the machinations of priestcraft, under the king of the
          age, Satan himself. Pastor Russell came with his message, in a day
          of supposed enlightenment, to a people <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-q">“Abib,”</span> sprouting, budding). Abib was another
          name for Nisan, the first month of the Hebrew sacred year,
          corresponding to April. In type or symbol a place represents a
          condition, or a stage in historic development. The <span class=

          year, symbolizes the dawn of the Times of Restitution, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Millennial Dawn.”</span> The Millennium
          (Rev. 20:3, 4, 7) began in 1874, with the Return of Christ. It was
          at about that time that Pastor Russell came to his
          fellow-Christians with the beginning of a better understanding of
          the Bible, <span class="tei tei-q">“the vision of God.”</span> It
          was, as it were, the budding-time of the good promises of God for
          the blessing of all peoples. The Christian people lived on and by

          feeds and supports Christendom, Babylon.</p>

          prophecy usually signifies a year in fulfillment. For seven years
          after Christ's Return in 1874—until 1881—Pastor Russell, although
          he knew much of God's Plan, was in some degree in the same
          condition as other Christians in imperfect understanding of God's
          Word. In 1881 a former associate, Mr. Barbour, of Rochester, N. Y.,
          who had been a faithful fellow-watcher, developed into the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Evil servant”</span> of Matt. 24:48-61 and
          Zechariah 11:17, and produced a work on the Hebrew Tabernacle types
          in opposition to the fundamentals of true Christianity. Pastor
          Russell desired the truth on the subject. He gave himself up to
          prayer and study of this matter alone. For days he struggled with
          the problem and wrestled with God in supplication. At length the
          matter cleared up. He then wrote <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Tabernacle Shadows of the Better
          Sacrifices</span></span>.”</span> of which 1,500,000 copies have
          since aided Christians to understand the deeper things of the Word
          and to make complete consecration unto death. This was in 1881, at
          which time he also published <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Food for Thinking
          Christians</span></span>,”</span> a work embodying much afterwards
          expanded into the six volumes of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Studies in the
          Scriptures</span></span>.”</span> The same year, 1881, is
          prophetically marked at the time for the final withdrawal of favor
          from the churches, a favor which had begun to be withdrawn in
          1878—the year in which the clergy were cast off as representatives
          of the Divine Word, and when Pastor Russell began his work by the
          publication of 50,000 copies of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Object and Manner of the Lord's
          Return</span></span>.”</span> In 1873 the stewardship of the things
          of God, the teaching of Bible truths, was taken from the clergy,
          unfaithful to their age-long <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> stewardship, and given to Pastor Russell. In
          the interim, until 1881, the new steward was setting the things in
          order, getting the truths of the Bible in logical and Scriptural
          form for presentation, until the last great item of the Hebrew
          Tabernacle types, was ready. Then, in 1881, he became God's
          watchman for all Christendom, and began his gigantic work of
          witness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:17.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Son
          of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel;
          therefore hear the word at My mouth, and give them warning from
          Me.</span></span>—The function of watchmanship was not given until
          1881. (Jer. 6:17; Isa. 21:6-12.) Faithfulness in individual
          watching during a trial period of seven years was rewarded by the
          bestowal of the office of the greatest servant whom the Church of
          God has had since the Apostle Paul. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Whosoever will be chief among you let him be your
          servant.”</span> (Matt. 20:27.) Pastor Russell at all times served
          the Church in great things and small. No request was too
          insignificant to get his careful attention. Rich and poor alike
          were faithfully served in every possible way. This work prior to
          1881 was a great work for any ordinary man, but insignificant
          compared with what was to follow. By 1884 the watchman's work had
          grown to such proportions as to cause the founding of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Watch Tower
          Bible and Tract Society</span></span>. This is the agency through
          which God's appointed watchman has delivered his message to
          Christendom. Pastor Russell paid no attention to the words or
          opinions of man, however learned or pious, whether men of modern
          days or the <span class="tei tei-q">“early fathers”</span> of
          post-apostolic times. He listened to the word direct from the mouth
          of God, spoken by holy men of old as moved by the Holy Spirit. (2
          Peter 1:21.) Ezekiel was raised up shortly before the destruction
          of Jerusalem to warn the Hebrews of the impending calamity. Pastor
          Russell's warning to Christendom, coming direct from God, has been
          of the imminent collapse of the present <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Christian”</span> civilization in a welter of war,
          revolution and anarchy, to be succeeded by the early establishment
          of the Kingdom of God. In all his warnings he claimed no
          originality. He said that he could never have written his books
          himself. It all came from God, through the enlightenment of the
          Holy Spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:18.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">When
          I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him
          not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way,
          to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity;
          but his blood will I require at thine hand.</span></span>—Pastor
          Russell saw and revived the teaching of the Word of God that death
          is death. <span class="tei tei-q">“All have sinned.”</span> (Rom.
          3:23.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Death passed upon all.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name=
          "Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (Romans 5:12.)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The wages of sin is death.”</span> (Rom.
          6:23.) <span class="tei tei-q">“There is none righteous.”</span>
          (Rom. 3:10.) <span class="tei tei-q">“The dead sleep in the
          dust.”</span> (Isa. 26:19.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Their thoughts
          perish.”</span> (Psa. 146:4.) He taught clearly the Word of God
          first enunciated to Adam, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
          surely die.”</span> (Gen. 2:17.) Man is not inherently immortal. At
          death he is dead, unconscious, asleep until the resurrection, not
          <span class="tei tei-q">“more alive than ever,”</span> as taught by
          a blinded and apostate priestcraft. Man, soul and body, is not a
          being whom God cannot destroy. <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear Him
          who is able to destroy both soul and body.”</span> (Matt. 10:28.)
          To all erring mankind Pastor Russell was directed by God to
          reiterate the Divine penalty for sin, as death, and not eternal
          torment. This was a fundamental part of the message both of Ezekiel
          and of Pastor Russell.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:19.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Yet
          if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor
          from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
          delivered thy soul.</span></span>—Pastor Russell faithfully warned
          the wicked. He published a complete exposition of the Bible
          statements regarding the Adamic death—3,000,000 copies of a
          pamphlet, <span class="tei tei-q">“What Say the Scriptures About
          Hell,”</span> quoting all Bible passages mentioning Sheol and
          Hades, the death state. He scarcely ever spoke in public without
          dwelling on this cardinal tenet, that the dead are dead. To the
          very best of his ability he taught Christendom the truth. By
          faithful testimony he delivered himself from liability.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:20, 21.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-family: sans-serif">Again, When a righteous man doth turn
          from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a
          stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not
          given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness
          which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I
          require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous
          man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall
          surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy
          soul.</span></span>—Another cardinal teaching of God's Word,
          clearly taught by Pastor Russell, is the nature of the eternal
          punishment to be visited upon the incorrigible backslider. Clergy,
          bishops and popes have taught for centuries on this subject an
          irrational combination of extreme symbolism with gross literalism,
          as suited their ambition to exercise worldly power and hold the
          masses in subjection—minds, bodies and pocketbooks. They have
          interpreted one symbolism symbolically and the next literally. They
          have said that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lake of Fire”</span>
          and the <span class="tei tei-q">“torment”</span> are literal, but
          that the <span class="tei tei-q">“beast”</span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“false prophet”</span> are symbolic (Rev.
          19:20), even though it involved the absurdity of a symbolic beast
          going into a literal lake of fire! Blind and deaf to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> those who have pointed out the
          unreasonableness of such foolishness, they have turned savagely
          upon those that have the Truth. In eighteen centuries they have
          killed fifty million adherents of Christ, and persecuted
          innumerable others. It is impossible to compute the number that
          they will do to death in this, the close of the Gospel-Age Harvest,
          when governmental protection shall be withdrawn from lovers of
          truth, except that, this time, they will get <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
          such!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An important
          feature of Pastor Russell's teaching is that the Scriptural
          punishment of the incorrigibly wicked is not life in torment but
          oblivion, annihilation, the <span class="tei tei-q">“second
          death”</span> (Rev. 21:8); that every one is, either in this life
          or after the resurrection, to be brought to a full knowledge of the
          Truth (1 Tim. 2:4); to receive some measure of the Holy Spirit;
          that those who incur the extreme penalty for sin will be only those
          who backslide beyond recovery. In full conformity with Ezekiel's
          prophecy Pastor Russell taught that <span class="tei tei-q">“when a
          righteous man doth commit iniquity, he shall die”</span>—the Second
          Death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3:22.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and He said unto me, Arise,

          thee.</span></span>—Ezekiel was impelled by the Holy Spirit to
          depart from the river Chebar with its teeming activities. Pastor
          Russell's consecration led him to separate himself from commercial
          activities and to give his life to the service of God. The hand of
          the Lord was upon him to do this. The Lord's people, the Hebrews,

          "tei tei-q">“valley.”</span> Pastor Russell turned from ordinary
          avocations to all the people dwelling in the Valley of the Shadow
          of Death (Psa. 23:4); and in that condition God communed with His
          true Watchman. Pastor Russell has been known to pass entire nights
          in prayer, and go about his work the next day as though nothing
          unusual had taken place.—Rev. 3:14.</p>

          was before Pastor Russell of the character, plan and work of the

          sought to carry it out.</p>

          Bible, into Pastor Russell's mind and setting him into action. All
          who have set themselves apart to do the will of God and have
          received the Holy Spirit, are members of Christ, in the House of
          Sons (Heb. 3:6), the Royal Priesthood. In the consecration of the
          typical priesthood, the priest shut himself in the Tabernacle for
          seven days. (Lev. 8:33.) (Seven symbolizes completeness.) So Christ
          and those in Him abide continually in the antitypical Holy, the
          spirit-begotten condition. Pastor Russell lived in the Spirit from
          his consecration to his death.</p>

          renders institutions based on past partial knowledge functionless;
          and consequently the adherents and beneficiaries of such
          institutions oppose the march of events. The clergy, trying to stem
          the tide of Truth, to uphold an effete ecclesiasticism tottering to
          its fall, put every restraint upon the influence of Pastor Russell;
          but the bands upon him served also to bind the tares more tightly
          into the organization bundles. (Matt. 13:30.) In fulfillment of the
          prophetic parable the bundles are to be destroyed in the anarchy
          about to ensue. Church members have been urged to get rid of every
          scrap of paper bearing the Message of Present Truth; the Truth has
          been preached against in practically every church in the English,
          German and Swedish speaking world; people have been warned against
          reading the Truth; Truth people have been discharged or refused
          employment; in Europe they have been imprisoned at hard labor; some
          have been done to death by firing squads; they have been forbidden
          to hold meetings. Neither Pastor Russell nor his fellow-believers
          were permitted to utter the Bible Truth before the congregations of
          ecclesiasticism. It was not to go out among <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“them,”</span> and his greatest work was the deepening
          of the spirit of consecration among those of the <span class=

          spiritual things to the carnally-minded (1 Cor. 3:1; John 16:12).
          But Pastor Russell never refrained from speaking or publishing the
          Word of God. The Bible teaches that the service of God must be of a
          willing heart. It is a privilege which may be accepted or rejected,
          as the hearer desires. Yet to the worldly, Pastor Russell was as

          Ezekiel's days, in Chaldea, a book was a collection of inscribed
          tiles. The Laodicean servant was to be a writer of books. In many
          articles and chapters on the kingdoms of this world and their
          judgment and fall, and that of their ecclesiastical, political and
          business systems, Pastor Russell portrays Christendom, typically
          spoken of as Jerusalem. It bore the Lord's name, but was defiled by
          the evil practices of its inhabitants. (C. 295.) As a type,
          Jerusalem represents particularly the ecclesiastical phase of
          Christendom.</p>

          against it, set the camp also against it, and set battering rams
          against it round about.</span></span>—Ecclesiasticism was to
          experience prolonged siege by a class symbolized by Ezekiel. The
          siege was to be conducted by Truth, encompassing the stronghold of
          the nominal city of God. Beleaguered ecclesiasticism was to go
          through experiences like that of a besieged city shut off from its
          province, shorn of its actual dominion, while nominally retaining
          it, cut off from the supplies that had flowed from the tributary
          peoples. In addition to the slow weakening of a close besiegement,
          it was to withstand occasional assaults, make sorties and go
          through a period of warfare, with only one possible end, the utter
          destruction of the city. The besieged city was surrounded on every
          side with a line of military works, trenches, palisades and forts,
          collectively called a fort; from which, especially from the
          principal center of offense, it was continually harassed by
          wearing-down activities and assaulted by surprise attacks. So
          ecclesiasticism was to be surrounded and placed on the defensive,
          by strongly entrenched and fortified enemies. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God is our fortress.”</span> (2 Sam. 22:2.) It was to
          be done by a class of progressive and liberty-loving Christians in
          revolt against and attack upon the intolerance, superstition, and
          tyranny of priestcraft.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ancient cities
          were surrounded by high walls, with frequent towers for watchmen,
          spearmen, bowmen and slingmen. The walls, in emergencies, were
          lined with such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg
          392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fighters and with throwers of boulders and firebrands. The attack
          was made upon a weak point in the wall; and an earthen mound or
          mounds was cast up to furnish an elevation from which to equalize
          for the besiegers the advantages of the defenders. The walls of
          ecclesiasticism are its defense of creeds and of formalism and, not
          least of all, of the civil powers and the men who stand as a
          bulwark against attack. A <span class="tei tei-q">“mount”</span>
          symbolizes a government. (Dan. 2:44, 45.) The nation (mount) was
          organized, militant Protestantism. The camp is the temporary
          abiding place of those who are fighting on the Lord's side. (Heb.
          13:13.) A battering ram was a device for battering down the wall of
          a city to make a breach for the attack of the soldiery.
          Ecclesiasticism has surrounded itself with walls of living stones,
          soldiers, police and other officers of the civil powers who protect
          the churches and church people (Isa. 59:10), educators to build up
          belief in ecclesiasticism, writers to write articles and books, and
          a host of other adherents and supporters. In the siege of
          ecclesiasticism the Lord's yeomen have attacked aggressively with
          books, newspapers, missionaries, lectures and education; seeking to
          loosen and dislodge some of the living stones surrounding organized
          error.—Jer. 6:6.</p>

          and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set

          siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of
          Israel.</span></span>—An iron pan, literally a <span class=

          Protestantism and beleaguered ecclesiasticism. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They were holpen with a little help”</span> (Dan.
          11:34). The civil powers were to stand as a wall of iron protecting
          the Lord's people from the persecuting power of ruling priestcraft.
          No breaches could be made in the wall. It was a <span class=

          and teeth of the beast of Daniel, symbolizes the agencies of an
          irresistible power. Turning the face toward or against anything was
          a mark of favor or of disfavor. (Psa. 104:29.) The Lord's people
          were resolutely to disfavor established ecclesiasticism and to
          besiege it from the Reformation to the close of the Harvest. When
          Ezekiel sees another doing something it usually signifies another
          than Pastor Russell doing it, but may signify Pastor Russell seeing
          himself, or the Ezekiel class. The Ezekiel prophecy types and
          symbolizes Pastor Russell or the Reformer class seeing Pastor
          Russell or the Reformer class or some member of that class doing
          the thing typed or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg

          symbolized. Here, the Protestant class from the Protestant
          Reformation down through the Harvest period, is seen systematically
          and effectually besieging established ecclesiasticism. The house of
          Israel ordinarily meant the Hebrew nation, the nominal fleshly
          house of Israel. The Hebrews were divided into the ten tribes
          (Israel), thoroughly infected with Pagan beliefs and practices, and
          the two tribes (Judah), holding more closely to Jehovah. In
          antitype, when both Israel and Judah are mentioned, and the
          prophecy is intended for an antitypical fulfillment, Israel
          signifies the Papacy and Judah signifies established Protestantism.
          Here the sign was to be the whole nominal house of Israel—all
          professing Christians, Catholics and Protestants.—Z. '05-179.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4:4.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Lie
          thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of
          Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt
          lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</span></span>—In verses
          4 to 6 Israel and Judah are included in the same picture, and
          signify Papacy and established, corrupted Protestantism. The left
          side was a sign of less favor. Romanism kept on in sin and kept
          adding, multiplying evil deeds, until iniquity should come to the
          full (Gen. 15:16). A day in prophecy signifies a year in
          fulfillment. (Num. 14:34.) Ezekiel here represents the reformer
          class which had to endure the iniquities of Papacy, both by
          persecution and by the shame of seeing professed Christians
          believing grossest error. The iniquity of Papacy, the house of
          Israel, lay in the fact that the Reformers had shown them insistent
          proofs of their wrong course, and yet they continued in their own
          way, heedless of the Divine warnings. Hence less favor has been
          felt by Jehovah toward them than toward Protestantism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4:5.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">For

          reform element was laid the burden of seeing the dupes of Papal
          priestcraft continually learning and living error. This was a
          burden upon conscience, and was repugnant to the enlightened mind
          of the reform element, known for centuries, in name at least, as
          Protestant. Priestcraft of the larger division of Christendom was
          to be under attack for 390 years, during which time the besieging
          element, the reformers, were to be protected from Papacy by the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“iron wall”</span> of the civil powers.
          This began in 1528 and ends in 1918. The year 1528 is one of the
          turning points of history. Protestantism in England and in Germany
          was in the balance. The sudden rise of Charles V of Germany to
          great power had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg
          394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          emboldened Pope Clement to side with Charles. He induced the
          Emperor to support a measure designed to limit the spread of
          Protestantism, to be followed by its utter destruction. Under the
          proposed law no Protestant was to convert a Romanist to the
          reformed faith, nor would it be allowable for Protestantism to
          spread to other countries. It meant for all Protestants an end such
          as the Huguenots came to in France, the suppression of the
          Renaissance with its <span class="tei tei-q">“increase of
          knowledge”</span> (Dan. 12:4), and the end of the prosperous and
          comparatively enlightened civilization of modern times. The future
          of the whole world, and of the Divine Plan, was at stake! A general
          war was barely avoided to destroy Lutheranism. Philip Landgrave of
          Saxony discovered the plot, took arms, and in 1528 forced indemnity
          from a Catholic bishop. Other princes of Germany stood with
          Philip.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To quote from
          Dr. Peter Bayne, LL. D., the historian (<span class=

          the Prince of Anhalt, and the representatives of Strasburg,
          Nurnberg and twelve other free cities, entered a solemn protest
          against the prospective revolution. They were called <span class=

          Kaiser, shall congeal the ever-advancing stream of progress and
          improvement, may take an honorable pride in tracing their spiritual
          descent to the intrepid Philip and the magnanimous and
          simple-hearted John.”</span> (p. 481): <span class="tei tei-q">“How
          thoroughly is the whole pageant of that war, 1528, erased from the
          memory of the present generation! And yet the effect of those
          events is not yet exhausted; nor would it be possible for any one
          without forming some comprehension of them, to understand how link
          added itself to link in the evolutionary chain of modern
          history.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Germany set
          up the iron wall of civic defense between the besieging Protestants
          and beleaguered Papacy. In England, too, the other great empire
          which has stood as an iron wall between the reform element and
          Papacy, the break with Rome began to take form in 1528. This was
          the year when Pope Clement appointed his legates, Correggio and
          Wolsey, to conduct the divorce trial of Queen Katherine of Aragon,
          at the behest of Henry VIII. (Rev. 8:8, 9.) As God raised up a
          willful, stubborn Pharaoh when He purposed to deliver the Hebrews
          from Egypt, so He raised up the lustful Henry VIII as the agent
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name=
          "Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> through whom the
          break should come between England and Rome. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The natural result”</span> [of Henry's divorce
          proceedings], says A. F. Pollard, the historian, in his

          "tei tei-q">“was the separation of England from Rome.”</span> Thus
          did Divine wisdom use <span class="tei tei-q">“the wrath of man to
          praise Him”</span> and cause the <span class="tei tei-q">“iron
          wall”</span> of the civil, military and naval powers of the British
          Empire, Germany, and of the United States, to stand an impregnable
          barrier against the persecuting power of Great Babylon. Safe behind
          the iron wall, the reform element was able to live and grow in its
          camp and to keep up its siege of Roman Catholic priestcraft.</p>

          represents Protestantism, the Protestant churches. Until 1878, when
          cast off by the returned and present Messiah, Protestantism enjoyed
          Divine favor, just as the two tribes, collectively called Judah,
          did as compared with the idolatrous ten tribes of Israel. After
          1874 the Present Truth took the form of a general overhauling of
          creeds and the announcement of Christ's Second Presence. This was
          unanimously rejected by the Protestant churches; and organized
          Protestant ecclesiasticism from 1878 on for forty years became the
          Judah of this type, besieged on every side by the reform element,

          true Protestant reform class, during the 390 and the 40 years set
          themselves to the attack upon priestcraft. Pastor Russell seldom
          spoke without some words of objection to or warning about
          ecclesiasticism. The arm symbolizes power (E. <span class=

          and the uncovering of the arm is as when a man takes off his coat
          in attacking a task. The siege was to be carried on with energy.
          The reform element was to preach continually, not condoning or
          excusing priestcraft, but directly and pointedly attacking it.</p>

          millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee
          bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt
          lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat
          thereof.</span></span>—These grains represent different grades of
          spiritual food, each kind of food to be eaten by the kind of
          Christian represented by the food. Wheat represents the true Gospel
          of the Kingdom, as in the parable of the sower (Matt. 13:1-30), and
          is the food of the Little Flock. Barley among the Hebrews was
          little esteemed, for it was the price of an adulteress. (Hos. 3:2.)
          It signifies the spiritual food of a class guilty of spiritual
          adultery, unhallowed alliance with the world in the bringing forth
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“strange”</span> children. (Hos. 5:7.)
          Beans, lentiles, millet and fitches represent grades of food
          inferior to wheat (which contains every element to support life)
          and inferior even to barley. Their continued use as foods, causes
          physical deficiencies, weaknesses and disease. Lentiles are usually
          cultivated for fodder. Millet is still inferior. Symbolically it
          represents Christians who <span class="tei tei-q">“have no depth of
          earth.”</span> (Matt. 13:5.) Vetches, sometimes called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“tares”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“prickly
          spelt,”</span> are a very poor food. Their prickly nature suggests
          a type of hard-to-get-along-with Christians, and the kind of
          mental, moral and spiritual food that produces them. In with some
          of the true wheat, in established churchianity, as shown by verse
          16, were to be gathered Christians of various degrees of
          development, each eating the kind of food corresponding to his
          Christian development, the wheat class assimilating the best of the
          Divine Word, and so on down to those who absorbed the poorest grade
          of spiritual provender, some of it food usually regarded as fit
          only for animals. This was the food the various classes should
          subsist on, each according to his capacity, from 1528 to 1918, and
          from 1878 to 1918.</p>

          of this mixture, were used by the very poor in times of scarcity,
          depicting the scarcity of spiritual food among the followers of
          ecclesiasticism. The poor, not having stones or ovens, baked their
          bread or cakes on heated stones or in the fire, or roasted them by
          placing them between layers of dung, which burns slowly. Only the
          dung of animals was used ordinarily. No insult or defilement was
          greater than to turn a man's house into a receptacle for human
          excrement. (Deut. 23:12-14.) Our Lord associated human dung with
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that which defileth a man.”</span> (Matt.
          15:11.) Luther spoke of the <span class="tei tei-q">“dunghill of

          symbolic fulfillment in and after 1918. It depicts the several
          kinds of troubles upon Christendom, and the causes provoking them.
          The shaving of the head represents the affliction of Christendom.
          (Isaiah 3:17, 20, 24; Jer. 7:29.) The shaving of the beard was part
          of the ceremonial treatment of a leper (Lev. 14:8, 9), and
          signifies that after 1918 Christendom will be treated by outraged
          Justice at a moral leper, unclean with incurable iniquity, the
          perverseness, which, in the face of continual preaching of the
          Gospel, led up to the recent wars.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ezek. 5:2, 12,

          D. Since in verse 12 a third part of the persons were to suffer
          death or affliction, the hair in verses 1, 2 and 3 signifies the
          people in Jerusalem—Christendom. In Samson's case the hair
          represented his strength; and here the hair cut off signifies that
          the people who are the strength of Christendom shall be cut off in
          the brief but terribly eventful period beginning in 1918 A. D. A
          third part are <span class="tei tei-q">“burned with fire in the

          and famine. (Deut. 32:24.) In 5:16, 17 the shafts of hunger are
          represented as the evil arrows of famine. The staff is that upon
          which one leans; the staff of bread is the food supply of
          Christendom. In 1916 there was already a 25 per cent. crop shortage
          throughout the world, presaging worse conditions to come. In verse

          detestable and abominable to God, until now it is termed
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the great whore,”</span> (apostate church

          Divine Justice will not spare nor pity, until upon Christendom has
          been visited all the righteous blood of hundreds of millions of
          victims of her long centuries of unchristian wars and

          judgment upon the nations. They reap as they have sown. In times

          of Jerusalem, Christendom, and the Divine punishment to be
          inflicted on her. Chapter 8 refers literally to the temple, and its
          defilement by the seating of an idol of Baal at the door near the
          Brazen Altar, by the desecration of its interior with symbols of
          Egyptian heathenism and by the practicing of heathen worship within
          the temple. This types the condition of the spiritual Temple of
          God, <span class="tei tei-q">“which Temple ye are”</span>, the
          Church of God, originally pure and holy, but defiled by the clergy
          with pagan practices. The type refers back to 2 Chronicles 33:1-9,
          where King Manasseh established heathen worship throughout
          Palestine, set up a carved image in Solomon's temple and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“made Judah and the inhabitants of
          Jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathens whom the Lord
          had destroyed before the children of Israel.”</span> This resulted
          in Manasseh's overthrow at the hands of the Assyrians. The name
          Manasseh means <span class="tei tei-q">“causing
          forgetfulness.”</span> He typed Satan, the god of this world, who,
          by his lying deceptions has made professing Christians forget God.
          Satan's chief <span class="tei tei-q">“angel of light”</span> is
          the pope of Rome, ably seconded in keeping the people in the dark

          Rome and by the bishops and ministers of an apostate Protestantism.
          These keep <span class="tei tei-q">“their people”</span> from real
          Bible study, and encourage them in their forgetfulness of God and
          their individual obligations to God, the Word of God, to
          fellow-Christians and to the world. The house is the House of the
          Sons of God, the consecrated. The elders, chosen by the people,
          represented all the people. The Protestant clergy continually sat
          before the Lord's steward, could not pick up a paper that they did
          not see his sermons in it; but they would not hear his words, and
          they rejected him and the truths which he so plainly and so kindly

          Spirit, the Ezekiel class is now taken up mentally into the powers
          of spiritual control, to discern the significance of the evil done

          to the door of the inner gate, the gate of the altar between the
          people's court and priest's court—(the same as the Tabernacle
          court.) They are brought to the antitypical Temple, to the Chord of
          God, to the Lord's people—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are the
          Temple of God”</span>. (1 Cor. 3:16.) <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          the Door”</span> (John 10:9.) The Door represents Christ, through
          whom all that enter must come. The North symbolizes the seat of
          Divine government, the spiritual phase of the Kingdom. (Isa.
          14:13.) The Door, Christ, looks toward, tends toward spiritual
          things. Those that enter through Christ are expected to look
          forward from the condition of belief to that of full consecration,
          the spirit-begotten condition. In the Door, in the very place of
          Christ, Manasseh, type of the devil, and an apostate clergy set up
          an idol, an image of the Devil himself. Those who thereafter
          entered the court had to worship the image, typing that under
          clergy rule all entering the church, the condition of belief, had
          to do honor to Satan, whose seat of chief power is at Rome, and
          whose influence spreads wherever the clergy class is found.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Baal”</span> means <span class=

          over God's heritage (1 Pet. 5:3), the Church. By perversion of the
          plain meaning of literal Bible statements, they have set up in the
          place of God the deity of the Devil. This God of Romanism and
          Protestantism is not one, but three; he inflicts tortures eternal;
          his favor can be bought for money; he dwells in earthly buildings
          (Acts 7:48), which are consecrated to him; he teaches the direct
          opposite of the Word of God—that the dead are alive; he favors
          spiritual adultery—the union of the church with the governments of
          this world; he fosters lordship of the clergy class. The clergy's
          God is plainly not Jehovah, but the ancient deity, hoary with the
          iniquities of ages—Baal—the Devil himself. God pity the clergy, who
          have so <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg

          they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel
          committeth here, that I should go far off from My sanctuary? but
          turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
          abominations.</span></span>—It is needless to look for abominations
          far off when such an abomination has been set up by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“impudent children”</span> at the very door of the
          Church.</p>

          He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a
          hole in the wall.</span></span>—In Solomon's temple the court of
          the priests was surrounded not by a simple wall, but by a row of
          rooms or chambers where the priests and Levites stayed. The hole in
          the wall was an opening or window into one of the chambers.</p>

          said He unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall, and when I had
          digged in the wall, behold a door.</span></span>—The wall was the
          wall of secrecy, misrepresentation and deception, by reason of
          which the pagan practices and beliefs of various classes of
          professed Christians were hidden from publicity and consequent
          popular judgment. A little was known about them, represented by the
          little hole in the wall. It is the work of the Ezekiel class to dig
          through the wall and throw the light on these hidden things. The
          time has come for judgment, and for everything that is done in a
          chamber to be proclaimed from the housetops. (Luke 12:3.) Once the
          wall of secrecy is dug through, the door is open to see whatever
          transpires.</p>

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> surrounded the court. They symbolize
          the condition of those who profess faith and justification, but
          whose lives and beliefs contradict their professions.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">So I
          went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and
          abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel,
          portrayed upon the wall round about.</span></span>—To the
          Egyptians, artistic portrayals of creatures had a religious
          significance. All kinds of living creatures were worshipped. Chief
          of these was the bull Apis, which symbolized life and especially
          the power of procreation. The devotees of the antitype are never so
          happy as when giving life to new spiritual offspring. The children
          thus begotten are mostly tares. But few of them have the life that
          comes from consecration to the Word of God. The revivalist and the
          clergy care little for any begotten of the Word of God and do
          little to help them grow up in Christ. They grow, if at all, like
          starved, neglected children. As the service of this worship could
          be conducted only by the regular priests of Egypt, so the
          antitypical work can be done only by the man-made clergy class of
          the world (Egypt) and those <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ordained”</span> by them. Among the creeping things,
          objects of worship, was the fly—the evangelist. (Rev. 16:2.) The
          prince of the flies was Beelzebub. Flies breed in and feed upon the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“dung hill of Popish decretals”</span> and
          other <span class="tei tei-q">“traditions of men.”</span> They
          never get far above earthly things, but circulate in the lower
          strata of the air—ecclesiasticism. They bite and annoy both worldly
          people and the Lord's people, as did the plague of flies in Egypt,
          and are specially persistent in the humid condition of a rain—a
          downpour of Truth. These, like all clergy-approved workers, are
          looked up to, worshipped by the people of Christendom. Other
          creeping things that fly signify degrading of forbidden beliefs and
          practices, attractive, garbed in the cloak of religion, under
          church auspices, as typed by their flying in the air,
          ecclesiastical powers; but they are displeasing to God and tending
          toward death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8:11.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of
          Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of
          Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud
          of incense went up.</span></span>—Worshipping the pictured images
          were the elders, or ancients, appointed by and representing all the
          people of Jerusalem. Jaazaniah was a Levite, typical of a believer
          in Christ. The word Shaphan means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sly”</span>, and suggests the slyness of the adherents
          of wrong beliefs. Jaazaniah means <span class="tei tei-q">“God is
          listening,”</span> and signifies the fact that whatever
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian”</span> sinners may say, God is
          actually paying attention. The censer was used to carry the fire in
          which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name=
          "Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> incense was burned.
          (Rev. 8:3.) It types the bearing of the fiery trials signified by
          the fire. The devotees of error suffer in its behalf, as Truth
          people suffer for the Truth. Incense types the heart's best
          endeavors, here wrongly directed by many professing Christians in
          the service of Satan, as were Saul's in persecuting Christians.
          (Acts 22:3, 4.) Tares are often more devoted to their errors than
          are the Lord's people to the Truth. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          children of this world are wiser in their generation than the
          children of light.”</span> (Luke 16:8.) It was unlawful for a
          Hebrew to burn incense, except as in the regular temple service. It
          is an abomination for a professing Christian to put forth his
          heart's best endeavors except in the service of God.</p>

          forsaken the earth.</span></span>—These departures from true
          Christian belief are carried on <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
          dark.”</span> (John 3:19.) Every tare, imitation Christian, has his
          own peculiar beliefs and practices in <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          chamber of his imagery,”</span> his mind. Because God knows how to
          defer retribution until the Day of Judgment (2 Pet. 2:9), these
          unwise ones delude themselves that the All-Seeing One does not see.
          Those not familiar with the Divine Plan of the Ages, seeing the
          conditions of savage war trending into worse things, apparently
          have the delusion that the Lord has forsaken the earth.</p>

          said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater
          abominations that they do. Then He brought me to the door of the
          gate of the Lord's house which was toward the north; and, behold,
          there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</span></span>—Tammuz means
          <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect (tam) by burning”</span> (muz). He
          was a heathen god whose death was lamented annually by women
          idolaters. He was the god of fire worship, the same as Molech, to
          whom children were burned alive. He types the
          eternal-torment-purgatory God, who perfects (supposedly) by the
          fires of purgatory. The women weeping for him typify the
          once-virgin churches, who honor the alleged hell-fire god and
          lament the ones in the fire. There is a unity of heathen religions
          with apostate <span class="tei tei-q">“Christianity”</span> which
          stamps them all as pagan. The original heathen god was Nimrod,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the mighty hunter”</span> of Gen. 10:8-14,
          where is related the origin of Babylon and Ninevah. Nimrod led men
          and women from the true religion of devout Noah into gross
          sensuality and neglect of the worship of Jehovah. He was beloved by
          fallen women. For his iniquitous influence, Nimrod was condemned to
          death by the council of judges; and his dead body was <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cut into pieces, which were sent to all
          parts of the inhabited world, with the threat of death to any who
          practiced his evil ways. Nimrod married his own mother, Semiramis,
          so that, in a sense, he was his own father and his own son. Here
          was the origin of the Trinity doctrine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The practices of
          Nimrod were continued in secret by Semiramis; and as every caution
          had to be taken, the things done were veiled in mystery. Each act
          and person was represented only in symbols known to the initiated.
          Here originated the various secret societies, with their
          blood-curdling oaths of secrecy—Masonry, Oddfellowship, Jesuitism,
          Knights of Malta, and so on. These are lineal descendants of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“mysteries”</span> of pagan sensuality, all
          of them abominations to God. Semiramis, to further her schemes,
          pretended that Nimrod, the father-son, had been raised from the
          dead in the form of the sun, which thus became an object of
          worship. She represented herself as the moon, which was also
          adored. This was the original Trinity—Nimrod the father, Nimrod, or
          Tammuz, the son and Semiramis the mother, the power, or spirit,
          back of all. As the people multiplied and scattered they took with
          them this heathen Trinity which appears in various nations in the
          partial list shown on the preceding page.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These under

          Tammuz, etc.,—in the stead of the true Seed, pushed Jehovah aside,
          then into the background, and then out altogether. The Devil,
          through the Pope of Rome, substituted forms of paganism for the
          simplicity of true Christianity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Such
          things are,”</span> says Cardinal Newman, <span class=

          worship,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“sanctified by
          adoption into the church.”</span> Roman Catholicism is a heathen
          religion. Protestantism also worships Molech, the fire god, Tammuz,
          the deity of torture, whom popes, cardinals, bishops, priests,
          clergy, ministers, and laymen unite in honoring and worshipping
          under the delusion that they are worshipping Jehovah, God of
          Abraham, the true God of the Bible. However, ignorantly,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they worship devils.”</span>—1 Cor.

          be in this court. They typified the believers and spirit-begotten
          ones of the Christian Church. They were divided into about
          twenty-five courses or sections and served in rotation. These typed
          the divisions of Christians into about twenty-five principal

          Word of Truth, which will manifest their true condition and cause

          toward the North, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and
          one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn

          the six great nations—Russia, Germany, Austria, France, England and
          Italy. The six with the Sword of the Spirit symbolize all the
          Elijah class, the six, with one other, making up the seven, the

          "tei tei-q">“the north,”</span> from the seat of Divine Dominion,
          from God Himself. Practically all Bible translators and
          commentators agree that the one with a writer's inkhorn by his side
          was not one of the six, but a seventh, garbed as a priest, or as a
          clerk or officer in an army of the East. The linen signifies the
          imputed righteousness of Christ, (Rev. 19:8.) The writer's inkhorn
          symbolizes that the seventh man's function was to write. God
          identified him thus: When <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Truth, painted the open Bible; and without instruction from any
          one, of his own volition, he painted the Bible as open at Ezekiel,
          Chapter 9. The man in linen was the Laodicean servant, the Lord's
          faithful and wise steward, Pastor Russell. When Pastor Russell saw
          this, he turned pale. Ezekiel seeing the man in linen, types Pastor
          Russell thereafter seeing himself to be the antitype of that
          man—one of the most prolific writers of the Age, and the only one
          to write and publish widely the glad tidings of the actual Second
          Presence of Christ. The seven men stood beside the brazen
          altar—there, in connection with God's Plan, based upon the Ransom
          sacrifice to receive their Divinely appointed commission.</p>

          Cross, the sacrifice of the Christ, Head and Body, and the part of
          the Church therein. It was the duty of the clerk or officer of an
          oriental army to mark the people, either for slaughter or to be

          death.”</span> (2 Cor. 2:14-16.) Those not believing Present Truth
          will become only the more confirmed in error. (2 Thes. 2:11.) They
          will be smitten by the Sword of the Spirit, which in them will
          operate at this time to destroy any pretense of being Christians,
          and cause them to take their proper stand as worldings—to be
          destroyed as tares. In this, God's <span class="tei tei-q">“strange
          work”</span> (Isa. 28:21), the Word of God will operate seemingly
          without pity, to separate the people into two classes, in Present
          Truth or out of it. In a literal sense the rulers of this evil Age
          will pitilessly carry the Sword throughout the lengths and breadths
          of Christendom.</p>

          not having the Holy Spirit, regardless of sex, will fall as tares,
          as will all of the idol worshipers of Christendom. The literal
          trouble will begin with a revolutionary outburst of anarchy against
          the churches and the clergy (1 Pet. 4:17), as responsible for the
          trouble because of having preached the people into the war, in the
          face of innumerable Scriptures against fighting with carnal weapons
          (Matt. 5:39, 44; John 18:11; 2 Cor. 10:4) and of those teaching
          Christians to love one another and to forgive trespasses (Luke
          6:27-38), personal or national. (Rom. 12:17-21.) The Sword of the
          Spirit will begin its work with the sanctuary class, the professing
          Christians (1 Pet. 4:17). It will begin with <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the ancient men”</span>, the representatives of the

          defiled by the presence in it of any one who has become spiritually
          dead. The priests and Levites alone might enter the priests' court;
          and this types that many professing to be consecrated Christians
          will lose all claim to being followers of Christ—be slain
          religiously. So many will thus lose belief that Christendom will be
          filled with them. Literally the sanctuaries and the streets of

          Gospel of Love they possess, both Romanism and Protestantism are
          guilty to an extraordinary degree before God. Christendom, through
          its savage wars, is drenched with blood. Churchianity is full of

          I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of
          the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone,
          as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</span></span>—Verses
          1, 8-11, 12, 14-22 are explained in Chapter 1. The repetition of
          the symbols of the Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power of God, of the
          wings (Word of God), of the wheels, and the wondrous light, are
          assurances that in the anarchous destruction of Christendom, our
          Father is acting wisely, justly, lovingly and in accordance with
          His Word and Plan for the good of mankind.—T. 125.</p>

          And he went in in my sight.</span></span>—Ezekiel, typing Pastor
          Russell, sees himself as acting in the manner here described. He
          was to go in between the wheels, to do his work in accordance with
          the Divine Plan, to act under the dictates of the Divine Justice,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the cherub.”</span> The coals of fire are
          symbolic of the fiery trials, distress, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“great tribulation,”</span> with which Christendom will
          be overwhelmed in the last period of the Time of Trouble, and the
          prophecies of these events. (Rev. 8:5.) These Divinely permitted
          troubles have the approval of Divine Wisdom, Justice, Love and
          Power, as necessary from every viewpoint, and the inevitable
          retribution of a long-forbearing God. Pastor Russell was to do this
          work,—<span class="tei tei-q">“fill his hand,”</span> with all his
          might, to devote himself wholly to this task. Over the whole world
          was scattered the warning of impending trouble.—D. 57.</p>

          the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man

          cherubim stood by the nominal Temple class—to inquire and visit the
          offences of Christendom. The house was on their left, the place of
          disfavor. When no priests were in the Holy, it was filled with a
          cloud. In 1 Kings 8:10 and in 2 Chron. 5:11-14 the cloud filled the
          Holy, and the priests were unable to serve there because

          cloud filled the Court, no one could see to serve in it. This types
          that in the Harvest period, from 1878 to 1918, while Pastor Russell
          was dispensing as part of the <span class="tei tei-q">“food in due

          been serving in the believing Court condition—clergy and other
          church workers—were no longer permitted to do so. It corresponds to
          the passing of the stewardship from the clergy to Pastor Russell in
          1878. This applies also to verse 4, where the presence of the cloud
          also types the presence of Jehovah to visit punishment for
          wickedness.—B. 138.</p>

          glory.</span></span>—Pastor Russell saw more clearly than any one
          in this end of the Age the glorious Gospel of God in the Ransom for
          all (Court and altar).</p>

          Word of God through Pastor Russell's proclamation of Present Truth.
          The inner Court typed the condition of faith and justification, and
          the outer Court typed the condition of those not fully believing,
          nor directly serving God. The preaching and writings of Pastor
          Russell were heard by all classes of believers and unbelievers. It
          was the voice of Jehovah, represented as almighty to save, that was
          heard throughout the world.</p>

          wheels.</span></span>—In the Divine Plan of the Ages Pastor Russell
          was to find clearly indicated the great tribulation then close at

          went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it;
          they turned not as they went.</span></span>—See Chapter 1 for
          explanation. The leading face in the head was the man's face,

          these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up
          themselves also; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
          Then the glory of the Lord departed from off the threshold of the
          house, and stood over the cherubim. And the cherubim lifted up
          their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they

          among whom I saw Jaazaniah, the son of Azur, and Pelatiah, the son
          of Benaiah, princes of the people.</span></span>—The east gate
          types Christ, the entrance to true Christianity. (John 10:9.) At
          the door of the gate were the leading sects, Jaazaniah, the son of
          Azur (helper) types the idea that by self-help man can please God.
          Pelatiah (Jah delivers), the son of Benaiah (Jah is intelligent),
          types the belief that earthly wisdom will deliver the world from
          its difficulties. (1 Cor. 1:21.) These were <span class=

          acts of nominal Christians.</p>

          Trouble is not near, and the destruction of Christendom is not to
          be thought of. (1 Thes. 5:3.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us build
          houses”</span> is an expression implying confidence in the
          permanence of things as they are. (2 Pet. 3:4.) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This city is the caldron, and we be the flesh”</span>
          (Jer. 1:13) is a proverb, here applied to the iron sides of the

          number is legion of those who would have liked to gain spiritual

          of it.</span></span>—Another sense in which the Jerusalem Jews used
          this proverb was that the Jews taken captive into Babylon were
          worthless, and they in Jerusalem were the valuable flesh remaining.
          (Mi. 3:3.) God here tells that the only ones to remain in
          Christendom will be the literally dead, or those who are dead to
          the claims of Mystic Babylon. These have the best chance of
          surviving the trouble. The walls, defences, military and police,
          will be broken down by war and revolution; and nothing can save the
          adherents of ecclesiasticism from their fate.</p>

          Lord.</span></span>—The devotees of established priestcraft fear
          both the literal sword and the Sword of the Spirit. The armies of
          the nations will be in open revolt against the established powers,
          religious, political and economic. Also the Sword of the Spirit,
          the Word of God, will cut through all pretense and bring about the
          death of religion in all not begotten of the Holy Spirit.</p>

          revolutionists and anarchists, Industrial Workers of the World,
          Syndicalists, Socialists, unfriendly to established systems, and
          spiritually into the power of the Word of God in the hands of His

          taken captive out of Jerusalem were tried and slain at Riblah (a
          bare place) outside of Palestine, typifying that the destroying
          judgments on Christendom will come upon her after her institutions

          having mistaught the Word of God, and having lived no better than

          throughout Christendom the idea that human wisdom, Prussian

          captivity were despised by those remaining in the <span class=

          Christendom who honestly own themselves to be of the world and are

          trees of the forest? Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or
          will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? Behold, it is
          cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of
          it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work? Behold,
          when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it
          be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is
          burned? Therefore thus saith the Lord God, As the vine tree among
          the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel,
          so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will set My face
          against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire
          shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I set
          My face against them. And I will make the land desolate, because
          they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord
          God.</span></span>—Ecclesiasticism, which imagines itself to be the
          true vine (John 15:1) with the sects as branches, is a wild vine
          (Rev. 14:18), unable to support itself and clinging like a parasite
          upon others for support. It brings forth no character fruitage, is
          unfit for any Divine purpose, is slender, half-charred by the
          assaults of Higher Criticism, and fit only to be destroyed.—Psa.

          fornication in a church is the desire to form a union with any

          were worshipers of Baal. With like parentage, ecclesiasticism is a

          many volumes the unity of all religions, herself included. Samaria,
          the ten apostate tribes, mingled the religion of Jehovah with that

          ministered to the beastly propensities of rulers and of others. The
          clergy, from Pope to class leader, prostituted religion for the

          thousands died in the exhilaration—mistaken for religious uplift—of
          self-sacrifice in their behalf. Ministers of Satan masquerading as
          angels of light, preached these falsities and millions believed
          them, and for their own good, and the good of the world which they
          have corrupted, God is about to take them away.—Z. '95-56.</p>

          with the desire of things seen with the fleshly eyes (1 John 2:16),

          Lord.</span></span>—God gave them up to doctrinal pollutions, in
          that they believed in and worshipped the eternal torment god,
          Moloch, the Devil, and singed, scorched spiritually, with the fear
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“the hot place,”</span> all their
          children, those young in nominal Christianity. (Jer. 32:35.) This
          caused them to be desolate, deserted, abandoned by the true God,
          like the heathen without God—though not that God might ultimately
          destroy them; for in the Times of Restitution they will by contrast
          appreciate the true God.</p>

          every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there

          the heathen were guilty of—union of church with worldly power,
          making the high ones the heads of the church, as the King of

          deride such a method (21:18-24), but the Hebrew crown is to be
          overturned. (21:25-57.) The Ammonites (aggressive worldly
          believers), too, are to be given to the sword.—21:28-32.</p>

          guidance of a demon which spoke to him clairaudiently, urging him
          to his present course. A surprising number of prominent men consult
          spirit mediums. The voice of the spirits was for war by every
          conceivable means, nation against nation, but destined to effect

          this same day.</span></span>—It was in the fall of 1916—a year and
          seven months before the city was to be smitten in the spring of
          1918—that the forces of laborism, revolution and anarchy, began to

          from which meat is taken; then it is set empty on the fire and the
          rust burned out. Ezekiel's wife dies; but he suppresses his
          feelings, and, after the ordinance for a priest, makes no mourning

          on the same day that the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“came, he and all his host, and pitched

          (2 Kings 25:1, 2.) Its antitype is that on or about November 1,
          1916, the date of Pastor Russell's death, ecclesiasticism began to
          enter upon its life-and-death struggle, materially, with the forces
          of laborism and anarchy, and religiously with the consecrated
          children of God, whose work from then on was increasingly to bear
          witness to the apostasy and imminent destruction of churchianity.
          Ecclesiasticism, rebellious against her God, is as an organization,
          like a caldron of brass (copper), typing that many of its members
          believe the Word of God. It is set amid the fiery troubles of
          revolution and anarchy. There is water in it, symbolic of what

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">And
          the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things
          are to us, that thou doest so?</span></span>—Why was Pastor Russell
          caused by his Father to endure the fiery trials and ecclesiastical
          falsehoods in connection with this incident of his life?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">24:20, 21.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Then
          I answered them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Speak
          unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I will
          profane My Sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire
          of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and
          your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the
          sword.</span></span>—God gives the reason. It was as a picture or
          parable of what is to happen to Christendom. Until 1878 the nominal
          church had been in a sense God's sanctuary or Temple; but He was
          from then on, culminating in 1918, to remove it with a stroke or
          plague of erroneous doctrines and deeds Divinely permitted. The
          Church was the strength of Christendom, that about which its life
          centered, and around which its institutions were built. It was the
          desire of the eyes of the people, that which all Christians loved.
          Nevertheless, God was to make manifest the profanation which
          ecclesiasticism had made of the Christian Church, and to cause the
          church organizations to become to Him as one dead, an unclean
          thing, not to be touched, or mourned. And the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“children of the church”</span> shall perish by the
          sword of war, revolution and anarchy, and by the Sword of the
          Spirit be made to see that they have lost their hope of life on the
          spirit plane—that <span class="tei tei-q">“the door is
          shut.”</span></p>

          ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat
          the bread of men.</span></span>—So universal and dreadful will be
          the troubles that the dead will literally lie unburied and unwept.
          There can be no mourning for the dead in a period when the living
          are overwhelmed by troubles worse than death.</p>

          mourning will be an inner sorrow of a people stupefied by terrible
          experiences, who pine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg

          apostate ecclesiasticism in revolution, in 1918, the end of the
          various discordant non-Christian elements of Christendom, hostile
          to true Christianity, which will seek to profit by her fall, will
          come. The Ammonites (25:1-7) and the Moabites (25:8-11), both
          children of Lot—who was himself a type of the Great Company
          class—are a type of a class brought into being by their father, the
          Great Company class (Lot), while he was in a state of drunken
          stupor from mixed doctrines, through Lot's daughters, type of the
          worldly churches of the Great Company. The Edomites, descendants of
          Esau, represent a class who sell their birthright to sonship of God
          for a mess of pottage, worldly advantage (25:12-14); and the
          Philistines, a people who migrated from Egypt, and aggressively
          preyed upon the Jews, type of a class of aggressive, middle-course,
          professing Christians who prey upon true Christians. The message
          begins with words against the Ammonites, types of those believing
          worldlings who were brought into the churches by the more or less
          faithless Great Company, and who in an aggressive and predatory
          fashion as Jesuits, persecuting Romish priests, and Protestant
          clergy and their kind persecuted the true Christians. The Ammonites
          are described as <span class="tei tei-q">“fierce marauders, crafty,
          cruel, predatory.”</span> The Ammonites worshipped Baal, under the
          name Chemosh, the god of fire and of fornication, type of the
          eternal-torment-purgatory god, the encourager of the spiritual
          adultery of church-state union.</p>

          guise of an elaborate system of philosophy. The name Tyrus
          signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“Rock;”</span> and human
          philosophy, particularly Greek Platonic philosophy, is the real
          rock foundation of ecclesiastical teachings. Any true ecclesiastic,
          when driven by the Word of God from his untenable errors, claims
          sanction for them by reference to the philosophy of Plato and the
          inherent immortality of man, etc.</p>

          system and its adherents will manifest their essentially
          non-Christian nature when Christendom (Jerusalem) falls at the
          hands of the revolutionists in 1918. Philosophy, Higher Criticism,
          will rejoice that ecclesiasticism, which claimed to be the gateway
          to God for the people, is broken. They will imagine that the
          adherents of a Christianity that has failed will turn to
          philosophy, and that the adherents of philosophy will be increased
          now that ecclesiasticism is desolated. Human philosophy will seem
          to be the sole refuge of the people of Christendom.</p>

          slew our Lord (Rev. 11:8), and has enslaved and slain millions of

          depicted in several ways: as the catching of a sea monster

          addition the downfall of her systems (32:9-10) as a worldly system
          destroyed by anarchy (32:11-16); as the going down of worldly
          Christendom to oblivion (32:17-21); as the fall into oblivion of
          the anarchists (32:22-23); of the Eastern mysticism in Christendom
          (32:24-25); of her worst classes (32:26-28); of the worldly
          religious people (32:29); of the church organization of
          ecclesiasticism (32:30), and of Christendom's king, Satan, and all
          his multitudes. (32:31-32.) The message begins with a lamentation
          over Satan (Pharaoh), king of worldly Christendom (Egypt), and his
          visible representatives, the apostate clergy. Among the nations
          they are as a lion in power and ferocity (lion also symbolizes the
          Devil); and as a monstrous power (whale) among the peoples (seas);
          they came with their sects (rivers), and muddied the Truth (waters)
          with their earthly-minded members, the clergy (feet), and filled

          could have reformed Christendom and prevented the world war and the

          Josephus says of this man that he boldly accused the clergy of
          Jerusalem with being the cause of the trouble upon the city. He was
          tried, accused of inciting anarchy, was found innocent, and was
          then slain by the clergy class. His fate represents experiences

          destruction of Christendom. If it had turned from its spiritual
          idolatry and harlotry to obey God it would have been saved from its
          impending doom. Its destruction is traceable directly to a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“small group of willful men,”</span>
          leaders and guides of the masses; namely the pope, the cardinals,
          bishops, priests, ministers, revivalists and other religious
          leaders who have mistaught rulers and people, and by their
          combination of worldly and religious teachings brought the world
          into a condition where the social elements are working their mutual
          destruction. God pity the clergy for what is coming upon them; for
          the people will surely recognize the part they have signally failed
          to play in not, by concerted preaching of true godliness, checking
          the world's mad rush to anarchy and annihilation.</p>

          Love, he shall have life everlasting. (Rom. 8:13, 14.) Symbolically
          it speaks to this evil state of affairs, or world, especially to
          that wicked one, ecclesiasticism, and enumerates its iniquities: it
          has sinned before God: it has broken God's Law of Love and every

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An essential
          factor in the power of this evil one, and an important part of the
          iniquity of ecclesiasticism is the Romish confessional, which many
          Episcopal and Protestant ecclesiastics would, if they could,
          establish in the harlot daughters, the daughter churches,
          Protestantism. This feature is of Pagan origin. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Auricular confession was enjoined in the Elusinian

          priest a spy upon the privacy of the home, the inner secrets of
          business and the confidential affairs of city, state, province, and
          nation. Theoretically the confessions are confidential, as Dr. Dens
          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not lawful to reveal anything
          that is told in confession, though it be to avoid the greatest evil

          fellows in rendering his own penitents more ridiculous than the
          rest. This breach of faith extends to the highest of Rome's

          "tei tei-q">“for the punishment of certain offences took advantage
          of the confessional, which ought to be an inviolable
          sanctuary.”</span> Pope Sixtus V (1521-1590) told the under clergy
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“they could make a report to the
          Pontiff, without any danger attached to revealing a confession, he
          giving them absolution for the whole.”</span> Elliott, a former
          priest, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Delineation of Roman
          Catholicism,”</span> says, <span class="tei tei-q">“All our
          conversation ran upon the stories he [another priest] heard in
          confession. It is the ordinary discourse of the priests, when they
          meet, to inform one another of what they have heard in confession.
          I was often present at such conferences, where the conversation was
          so indecent that even an honest pagan would have blushed.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Every day they (the Dominican monks) came
          and talked most licentiously, relating things that had happened at
          the Holy office at Perugia, confessions they had heard,
          etc.”</span>—Scipione Ricca, Bishop of Pistoria, and an Italian

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bishop Hugh
          Latimer, of England (1485-1555), whom the Romish ecclesiasticism
          caused to be burned at the stake, said: <span class=

          men's hearts, so that neither emperor nor king could say nor do,
          nor think anything in his heart, but they knew it, and so applied
          all the purposes and intents of princes to their own commodities.
          And this was the fruit of their auricular confession.”</span>
          Finally, from De Sanctis, page 133, etc: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Confession in relation to society may be defined as an
          universal spydom, organized and complete. Confessors are not
          content to know the sins of those who confess; but they must learn
          the regulation and management of the family; and when an ingenuous
          youth or innocent maiden comes under the fangs of a knavish
          confessor (and which of them is not a knave?) they do not escape
          until they have first revealed the secrets of the family
          circle—without, however, being aware of it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“De Sanctis”</span> continues: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Encouragement is given to theft, as to every other
          crime, by the facility of obtaining pardon, and absolutions are
          given to robbers, usurers, murderers, without their having made any
          restitution whatever. They repair to the confessor, present him
          with a goodly offering for a mass; or, if they are robbers of
          celebrity, men abounding in wealth, they found a chapelry, a
          benefice, or something of the kind. At Rome, for instance, every
          one knows that Pius VII (1742-1823) granted <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a name="Pg527" id="Pg527"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to all who hear confessions in the Holy
          house Ponterotto, the privilege of absolving from restitution all
          who have defrauded the Rev. Apostolic Chambers, or the government;
          and all defraud, and run there to receive absolution. But this is
          not enough. Leo X (1475-1521), in his bull beginning with
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Postquam ad Apostulatus’</span> gives
          confessors the privilege not only of absolving robbers, but of
          permitting them to retain in all good conscience, the fruits of
          their usury, robberies, thefts, etc., on condition that part of the
          goods be given to the church!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ecclesiasticism
          is a greedy robber: <span class="tei tei-q">“By confession many
          families are immersed in poverty; because the grasping confessor,
          taking advantage of the weak moments of a dying man, has had the
          will made to the profit of the clergy; and facts of the kind may be
          reckoned by the million. The grasping cupidity of ecclesiasticism's
          will-hunters, and the consequent ruin of innocent and helpless
          families, formed the subject of an indignant remonstrance of the
          German princes at the Diet of Nuremberg. To such a length was this
          execrable practice sometimes carried that the last sacraments were
          denied to the dying man until he consented to make a will in the
          priest's favor.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
          Ecclesiasticism's apostasy, in teachings and in life, has sown the
          seeds of the fiery harvest of anarchy: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          horrible consequence for religion is that infidelity advances with
          huge strides, especially in Roman Catholic countries. The
          enlightenment of the age no longer permits men to believe in the
          priests blindly, as in the times of ignorance. Free discussion
          alone could show that the doctrines of the Roman church are not
          those of the Gospel; discussion, as it would prove their falsehood
          to a demonstration, would establish the truth. Discussion being
          prevented, it follows that, seeing clearly the falsehood and
          iniquity of the Roman doctrines, men believe them, because they are
          not discussed, to be the doctrines of the Christian religion, and
          abandon them, and live in indifference and infidelity.”</span>
          Protestantism, ecclesiasticism, has been an apt follower of Papacy
          in suppression of discussion. Witness the systematic world-wide ban
          on any discussion of Present Truth as presented by God's watchman,
          Pastor Russell! Ecclesiasticism, priestcraft, had for ages
          supplanted the worship of God with paganism, and in the Gospel Age
          has insidiously transformed the Gospel of Christ, has tried to
          destroy liberty and progress and has built up a gigantic system of
          oppression and destruction of the friends of the Truth. The most
          ferocious of the popes are made the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“saints”</span> of Satan's church. And, says De
          Sanctis: <span class="tei tei-q">“In canonizing such men, the Popes
          have canonized their doctrines; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page528">[pg 528]</span><a name="Pg528" id="Pg528" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> hence it cannot he said that despotism,
          obscuration [suppression of Truth], oppression of nations, and
          hatred for any kind of progress, exist through the mal-practice of
          any one of the popes; they exist by the very system of the Papacy.
          The corruption of religion ought not to be attributed to abuse of
          it by the individual, but to the system; therefore the Gospel ought
          to reign in its purity, and ought to be delivered from this great
          enemy; and Italy and Rome ought to confer upon the world this great
          benefit of despoiling the popes of their usurped power.”</span> Why
          not reform, purge, cleanse ecclesiasticism? As well try to reform
          cancer. The sole safeguard is the destruction, excision of the
          germs. Any real reform would cause the prompt dropping out of the
          system-loving millions who would soon reorganize into another
          vicious system. The very constitution of ecclesiasticism forbids
          its ever being other than what the Wall Street Journal denominates,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that international nuisance, the
          church-state.”</span> Here are some of the articles of Papacy's
          present, past and future constitution (infallible):</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. All human
          power is evil, and must therefore be under the Pope. 2. The
          temporal powers must act unconditionally, in accordance with the
          orders of the spiritual. 3. The Church is empowered to grant or
          take away any temporal possession. 4. The Pope has the right to
          give countries and nations which are non-Catholic to Catholic
          regents, who can reduce them to slavery. 5. The Pope can make
          slaves of those Christian subjects whose prince or ruling power is
          interdicted by the Pope. 6. The laws of the Church concerning the
          liberty of the Church and the Papal power are based upon Divine
          inspiration. 7. The Pope has the right to practice the
          unconditional censure of books. 8. The Pope has the right to annul
          state laws, treaties, constitutions, etc.; to absolve from
          obedience thereto, as soon as they seem detrimental to the rights
          of the Church, or those of the clergy. 9. The Pope possesses the
          right of admonishing, and if needs be of punishing, the temporal
          rulers, emperors and kings, as well as of drawing before the
          spiritual forum any case in which a mortal sin occurs. 10. Without
          the consent of the Pope no tax or rate of any kind can be levied
          upon a clergyman or upon any church whatsoever. 11. The Pope has
          the right to absolve from oaths, and obedience to the persons and
          the laws of the princes whom he excommunicates. (Note. All
          Protestants are excommunicated.) 12. The Pope can annul all legal
          relations of those in ban, especially their marriage. 13. The Pope
          can release from every obligation, oath, vow, either before or
          after being made. 14. The execution of Papal <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page529">[pg 529]</span><a name="Pg529" id="Pg529"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> commands for the persecution of
          heretics causes remission of sins. 15. He who kills one that is
          excommunicated is no murderer in a legal sense.<span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Protestantism
          longs for the old-time power of the clergy. It has the spirit,
          disposition, of spiritual fornication, goes to the limit in its
          efforts to control affairs through local, state, and national
          governmental agencies, and now is ready and willing to ally itself
          with liberty-destroying papal ecclesiasticism. It displays its true
          nature and its indifference to the good of the people in its
          willing eagerness to unite in any manner with the force which has
          for centuries throttled liberty, banished the Word of God, and
          stifled freedom in blood. Let not the people of Christendom
          overlook this when the Protestant clergy advocate church union, as
          they will. What can be done with such an organization as apostate
          ecclesiasticism? The truly Christian individual's answer must be to
          obey the Divine command, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come out of her,

          unhallowed partnership and federation with iniquity.
          Ecclesiasticism, however, may rest assured that she will not suffer
          greatly in loss of members or of persons of wealth and power; for
          but few of the Lord's people are in her. Each ecclesiastic can be

          it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth
          month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out
          of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is
          smitten.</span></span>—In 24:25-27, after having cited the
          skepticism of the Jews as to Ezekiel's message, it was stated that
          from the time of Jerusalem's fall until the tidings of the fall
          should arrive, Ezekiel was to be dumb, having no new message to be
          heard by the people. The intervening prophecies, chapters 26 to 32
          are not against the Hebrews, but against the heathen nations. The
          city fell in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign, the fourth
          month, the ninth day (2 Kings 25:2, 3), from which to the coming of
          the tidings of the city's fall, on the twelfth year, tenth month
          and fifth day, was one year, five months, twenty-six days. On that
          momentous day came the tidings, <span class="tei tei-q">“The city
          is smitten!”</span> Pastor Russell's voice was stilled in death on
          October 31, 1916. If an application of Ezekiel's period of dumbness
          is valid here as a time feature, the tidings, the realization that
          Christendom is smitten by the onslaughts of revolution, might be
          expected to flash throughout the world on or about April 27, 1918,
          a year, five months and twenty-six days after the death of God's
          great watchman. As in Ezekiel 24:27, this would be a sign, an
          indication to Christendom of the truth of Pastor Russell's
          commission from the Almighty.</p>

          the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, afore he that was

          dumb.</span></span>—The Lord made good His promise while the news
          was approaching; and removed Ezekiel's dumbness half a day before,
          in the evening, before the morning when the tidings arrived. It was
          on the same day; for in the Hebrew system of time, the evening
          began the day. This signifies that perhaps half a year prior to the
          general realization of Christendom's downfall, Pastor Russell,
          though dead, shall again speak through this, the seventh volume of
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          be left in undisturbed possession, but certain of them came into
          further conflict with the Assyrians. Then the land was made utterly
          desolate. This signifies, in fulfillment, that while the revolution
          overthrowing ecclesiasticism will make quite a clean sweep, there
          will still remain some of the more lowly adherents of
          ecclesiastical systems, who will imagine that they and their ideals
          are to prosper and spread even to the control of the revolutionary

          burning arraignment of ecclesiasticism. It is to be taken in a dual
          sense as concerning the clergy's treatment of God's true people,
          the true Church on the spiritual plane, and of the Jews on the
          earthly plane, both of whom the self-appointed shepherds, the
          clergy, have neglected, abused and scattered. (34:1-8, 17-21.) God
          will judge ecclesiasticism (34:9, 10, 16, 17, 20, 22), and will
          Himself, through His own agencies, regather and bless His true
          flock, Jewish and Christian. (34:10, 11-17, 22-31.) The words
          <span class="tei tei-q">“shepherd”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“pastor”</span> have the same meaning (D. 62; F. 287).
          Thus saith Jehovah God to the clergy, from Pope to preachers,
          Woe—in the revolution and anarchy, from 1918 on—woe to the clergy
          that selfishly look out for <span class="tei tei-q">“No. 1,”</span>
          that seek big salaries, live in tax-free and rent-free parsonages
          and rectories, that apply to themselves every promise of the Divine

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">37:1.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">The
          hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of
          the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full
          of bones.</span></span>—Chapter 37:1-14 has a fourfold application:
          (1) to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the Adamic death, into which the
          Hebrew nation has gone; (2) to the captivity of the Hebrews in
          literal Babylonia; (3) the captivity of the Hebrews in Mystic
          Babylon, Christendom; and (4) the dead condition of the hopes of
          Christendom in and after the Time of Trouble. It is because the
          Jews were types of the Christians that the blessed fulfilment of
          this prophecy applies with peculiar force to Christendom in and
          after the Time of Trouble. The power (hand) of Jehovah was upon
          Ezekiel to enable him to see and expound this vision for the
          benefit of the Hebrews and their dead hopes in captivity (2) in
          literal Babylon, (3) in Mystic Babylon (Christendom) and (1) in the
          Adamic death. (Z. '99-190; '01-358.) The power of God is now upon
          His people to understand the application of the vision of dry bones
          as pertaining to the hopes of (4) the people of Christendom, who,
          though believers in God, have not the Holy Spirit to illuminate
          their mental vision, and who will find themselves in the depths
          (valley) of despair in and after the Time of Trouble.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition of
          the withered hopes of Christendom in the Time of Trouble and death
          is pictured by the Valley of Jehoshaphat (Joel 3:2, 9-14):
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I will gather all nations, and will bring
          them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat [of judgment and death],
          and will plead [in war, revolution and anarchy] with them there for
          My people and My heritage Israel [the true Church] whom they have
          scattered among the nations, and parted My land [into several
          hundred denominations]. Proclaim ye this among the nations: Prepare
          war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let
          them come up; beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning
          hooks into spears; let the weak [Belgium, etc.] say, I am strong.
          Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
          yourselves together round about; thither cause thy mighty ones [the
          Little Flock, mighty in the power of the Lord] to come down, O
          Lord. Let the heathen [in Christendom, and out] <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be wakened, and come up to the Valley
          of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round
          about. Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest [of the vine of the
          earth, (Rev. 14:19) Christendom] is ripe; come, get you down; for
          the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is
          great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision [for or
          against God and His Word] for the Day [of vengeance] of the Lord is
          near in the valley of decision.”</span>—Joel 3:2, 9-15.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vast will be the
          slaughter, complete the devastation, heart-rending the ruin and the
          desolation of the hopes and aspirations of Christendom in the dark
          and gloomy valley of the Day of Vengeance of Jehovah. It will
          indeed be a valley—a cast down, humbled, lowly condition, in which
          the people of proud Christendom will suddenly find themselves, a
          condition full of the memories of ruined hopes, (bones) (Mal. 4:1.)
          The valley is full of dried-up hopes (bones): (1) the twelve tribes
          of Israel in death; (2, 3) the Hebrews in captivity to literal and
          mystical Babylon; and (4) the hopes of Christendom.</p>

          Scripture, were very many, but until the regathering out of literal
          and mystical Babylon, and from the dead, were and shall be
          lifeless. Pastor Russell, in Volume IV of <span class=

          and all the world to better, higher things. And their hopes shall
          live again; for God will cause the spirit of life, life-energy, to
          enter into their hopes and into their dead—those captive in the
          Adamic death and in the ruin of the great tribulation.—E.

          <span class="tei tei-q">“a shaking”</span>—the commotion incident
          to the fall of Babylon and the transfer of the empire to the Medes
          and Persians, typifying the coming Time of Trouble. And while
          Pastor Russell was preaching there began—in 1914—the shaking of
          Christendom, in wars, revolutions and anarchy, preparatory to the
          transfer of the rulership from Mystic Babylon, Christendom, to the
          two-phase, spiritual and natural, Kingdom of God; also the
          Zionistic hopes of the Jews began to assume definite, connected and
          Scriptural form. In due time, after the hopes of Christendom shall
          have been utterly ruined in the trouble, there will be <span class=

          Christendom, where men will be awaiting it with prayer and
          supplication. And behold! all Christendom will be shaken with
          emotion and with a revival of hope; and all the good hopes of
          Christendom, whose realization hitherto had been vague and
          disconnected, will be seen in their proper and Divinely appointed

          Hebrews captive in Babylon, hope grew strong and positive, and the
          protection of Jehovah (skin) was seen to be upon it, but yet there
          was no vitality to it. The time was not ripe for the fruition of

          preached to the Jews about their Zionist hopes, and pointed them to
          the Hebrew Bible to understand the proper fulfillment of their
          hopes; and while he was preaching Zionism grew into a strong
          movement. There is a due time also for Christendom's hopes to be
          strengthened by the books of Pastor Russell in millions of homes
          throughout Christendom. The surviving people of Christendom will
          read the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          and after the time of the ruination of their hopes. But even then

          <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=

          whole power (four winds) of God as concerned the Hebrew nation in
          captivity in literal Babylon should be exercised to cause the
          revival of their national and Messianic hopes. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The words that I speak, they are Spirit.”</span> The
          whole Word of God (four winds, the whole Spirit) foretold the
          regathering of the willing and obedient of the Hebrews from Babylon
          to Jerusalem, after seventy years' captivity. Pastor Russell, as
          Ezekiel's antitype, was commissioned to say to the Hebrews,
          scattered throughout the world in captivity in Mystic Babylon,
          Christendom, that the whole Word of God pointed to two great
          blessings: (1) the revival of their Zionist hope and its
          realization in the regathering of many Hebrews to Jerusalem, and
          the founding there of the world-wide Hebrew dominion over the whole
          world, into which should be gathered, out of Mystic Babylon, all
          the Hebrews in the world, wherever they might remain; and (2) the
          regathering of the Hebrews of all ages from the captivity of
          death—the tomb—to live on earth again in the earthly phase of the
          Kingdom of God, under the invisible spiritual dominion of Christ,
          Head and Body, and under the visible earthly rulership of the
          resurrected Ancient Worthies. Beginning in October, 1910, Pastor
          Russell called the attention of Hebrews by thousands, throughout
          the world, to the fact that the whole Old Testament foretold this
          as the legitimate aspiration of the Hebrews. For the Christian
          people of the world Pastor Russell has a similar message:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) For
          believing Christians having the Holy Spirit, he revived their hopes
          and pointed out clearly their gathering out from captivity in
          Mystic Babylon and in death, unto the glorious spirit phase of the
          Kingdom of God. (2) For the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page555">[pg 555]</span><a name="Pg555" id="Pg555" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> mass of professing Christians, who through
          some measure of unbelief or of unfaithfulness are not begotten of
          the Spirit to a change of nature from human to spiritual, He has a
          Divine message, which in due time will bring strong hope and
          comfort. As the Time of Trouble progresses, professing Christians
          by the millions, losing faith, as did the Apostles when, on the
          arrest of Christ they all forsook Him and fled, will forsake
          Christianity and all profession of being Christians. They will lose
          all the hopes they had as Christians. Then Pastor Russell's message
          will preach to Christendom the necessity of receiving the Holy
          Spirit in its entirety, in order to realize their hopes; will turn
          the people to the whole Truth of the Word of God (the four Winds,
          all the Truth), all the witness of the Spirit for them, that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“salvation cometh of the Jew”</span> (John
          4:22), and that they must connect themselves with the Ancient
          Worthies, resurrected and reigning at Jerusalem; for without these
          Worthies their hopes must remain inactive—through them alone hope
          can be vitalized. Then Christendom will pray to God, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We submit ourselves wholly to Thee in heartfelt
          consecration. Come, O Spirit, all the Spirit, in the appointed way,
          and breathe life into our hopes, that they may live at

          seventy years captivity. As a result of Pastor Russell's teaching,
          Zionistic hopes have gained new vitality; and in due time the
          Hebrew dead will come forth from the Adamic death in multitudes.
          From his teachings to the true Church, captive in Mystic Babylon,
          Christendom, the Scriptural hopes of the Church were clearly seen,
          and vitalized for those in Present Truth. From his teachings hope
          will grow afresh in the hearts of the survivors of desolated
          Christendom; and as a result of their prayers the dead of
          Christendom will come forth, an exceeding great army.—E.

          righteousness). His standing was in the east gate of the
          Sanctuary—in Christ (gate). With the Word he measured the Temple
          (the Church, and the subsidiary classes) and with the standard of
          perfect Divine righteousness (flax, linen) he measured the progress
          of the life-giving River of Truth.—Ezek. 40:3; 43:6; 44:4;

          mankind. Its division among the twelve tribes, in equal parts
          varying in nearness to the central sacred portion, suggests, among
          restored humanity, twelve conditions or degrees of honor in the
          Kingdom, each individual being accorded a place befitting his
          loyalty and love during his trial or judgment period. The meaning

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the north of
          the sacred portion: Judah (praise, Gen. 49:8-12); Reuben (behold a
          son, Gen. 49:3-4); Ephraim (doubly fruitful, Gen. 48:15-20);
          Manasseh (causing forgetfulness, Gen. 48:15-20); Naphtali
          (wrestling, Gen. 49:21); Asher (happy, Gen. 49:20); and at the
          extreme north, Dan (judge, Gen. 49:16-18).—Ezek. 48:1-7.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the south of

          Gen. 49:14-15); Zebulun (dwelling, Gen. 49:13); and at the extreme
          south, Gad (seer, lot, fortune, Gen. 49:19). (Ezek. 48:23-29.) The
          name meanings and Jacob's prophetic blessings are significant of

          (food), Sibraim (double hill), Hazar-Hatticon (middle court),
          Hauran (cave district), Hazar-enan (court of the fountains) and

          consecration. (Ezek. 45:1.) Whatever the honor attained, it cannot
          be taken away. (Ezek. 46:18.) All are to have an equal chance.
          (Ezek. 47:14.) Former pagan and heathen persons (strangers) are to

          Outer Court.</span></span>—The Sanctuary will be the entire
          enclosure devoted to the Divine service. According to Ezekiel 45:2
          the exterior wall is around a square of 500 cubits, and by 42:16-20
          it is 500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">reeds</span></span>, or 3,000 cubits square;
          but the latter is translated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cubits”</span> in the Septuagint, and the former
          agrees minutely with the internal measurements. About the outer
          court of 500 cubits square will be a border or suburb 50 cubits
          wide to separate the Sanctuary from the surrounding land. (Ezek.
          42:20.) The outer court types the condition of the Ancient Worthies
          and of the Hebrews and the world of mankind, the former of actually
          perfect humanity, and the latter of a perfect heart condition and
          striving toward human perfection. This court will be at an
          elevation above the surrounding land and will be reached by seven
          steps, symbolizing the human perfection, actual or heart, of those
          that enter the court. It will be surrounded by a wall one reed high
          and a reed thick. The wall types Christ in the Ancient Worthies,
          who will constitute the embodiment of the Divinely appointed wall
          of faith about the Sanctuary. The reed indicates the full measure
          of the Divine Word as regards the human nature.—Ezek. 40:6, 17-19,
          22-23, 27, 34; 42:1, 7-9, 14-20; 43:1-5; 44:1-3, 19; 45:1-2;
          46:19-24.</p>

          Court.</span></span>—The inner court will be an enclosure toward
          the rear or west of the outer court, 200 cubits wide by 300 deep.
          It types the spirit-born condition of the Great Company (Levites),
          and is at an elevation of eight steps, symbolizing by one step the
          change to spirit nature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page579">[pg
          579]</span><a name="Pg579" id="Pg579" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and by seven steps the perfection of that nature—perfect, though
          not the highest nature. Its wall represents Christ in the Great
          Company, and the absence of dimensions for the wall represents that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it doth not yet appear”</span> what the
          spirit nature is like. Both inner and outer courts will be adorned
          with colonnades of pillars, probably along the inner border of the
          pavements, typing those on each plane of being who shall be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pillars in the house of
          Jehovah.”</span>—Ezekiel 40:27, 28, 34, 37, 39-47; 42:2-4; 43:4-5;
          44:17-18, 21, 25-27; 46:19-24.</p>

          the rear and reaching to within 50 cubits of the rear of the inner
          court. It will be on a platform 60 cubits wide by 100 deep. This
          types the condition of the Little Flock, born from the dead to the
          nature of God. It will be elevated one reed above the inner court,
          representing that the Divine nature is the full measure of the Word
          of God above any other spirit nature, <span class="tei tei-q">“far
          above angels, principalities and powers.”</span> Its infinite
          height above other natures is indicated by the fact that the number
          of steps up to it is not stated, for it is an immeasurable,
          infinite elevation. (41:8-11.) The Temple will be entered by a
          porch, and will contain <span class="tei tei-q">“the holy”</span>
          twenty by forty cubits, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Most
          Holy”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“oracle”</span> twenty
          cubits square, inside measurement. These rooms type the glorious
          condition of the Christ, Head and Body, of the nature of God. That
          the person being shown tills did not enter the Most Holy (Ez. 41:3,
          4) suggests that it is not given to know yet <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what we shall be,”</span> in that condition where
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the glory of Jehovah filled the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Pavements and
          Open Ways.</span></span>—The outer and inner courts will not be
          simple inclosures, as was the Tabernacle court, but each will
          include a bordering space, or pavement, 50 cubits wide, occupied by
          gates, buildings, and passage ways, typing conditions and
          activities in the condition typed by the inclosure. That embraced
          by the outer court will be the <span class="tei tei-q">“lower
          pavement.”</span> (40:17-18.) This will contain the east, north and
          south gates of the outer court, and four corner courts where the
          Levites will bake and boil the sacrifices of the people. It will
          also contain 30 chambers, typing that number of conditions or
          activities among those resurrected and perfected or progressing
          toward human perfection. Each of the four corner courts upon the
          lower pavement will be 30 by 40 cubits in size and will be
          surrounded by a row of structures under which will be the boiling
          places for the preparation of their sacrifices to be eaten by the
          people. (Ezek. 46:21-24.) At the center of the east, north and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page580">[pg 580]</span><a name=
          "Pg580" id="Pg580" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> south lower
          pavements will be the outer gates, like covered corridors or
          lobbies extending entirely across the 50-cubit pavement to the
          outer court proper, as shown in Figure 3.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          corresponding 50-cubit pavement of the inner court is not
          definitely termed a pavement, but the name is inferred from the
          designation <span class="tei tei-q">“lower pavement”</span> for the
          outer court pavement. It will contain the inner court gate, and
          buildings for certain activities of the priests and the Levites.
          The inner court 50-cubit pavement leaves an inner space of 100
          cubits square—the inner court proper—facing the Temple and with the
          brazen altar in the middle. This 100-cubit-wide area will extend
          west about the Temple platform, surrounding it on the north, west
          and south, with an open space 20 cubits wide, called <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the separate place.”</span> On the upper pavement,
          flanking the Temple north and south, and of the same length—100
          cubits—as the Temple, will be two buildings on each side for the
          priests, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“priests'
          chambers.”</span> These buildings will be separated from each other
          by a 10-cubit walk along the center line of the upper pavement. The
          outer of each of the two pairs of <span class="tei tei-q">“priests'
          chambers”</span> will be 50 cubits long, half the length of the
          inner buildings. These are located on the upper pavement. At the
          rear or west end of the upper pavement will be little square
          courts, similar to the corner courts of the lower pavement, and
          used by the priests for boiling and baking the sacrifices eaten by
          the priests.—Ezek. 40:17-18; 41:10-15; 42:1-14; 45:2; 46:19-24.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lesser
          elevation of the plane of these pavements, courts and ways, types
          the lower plane of Spiritual being of the persons, and their
          activities type things to be done on that plane.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Chambers and
          Galleries for Priests.</span></span>—In the inner court near the
          north gate will be a chamber (Fig 3, D) with a door looking toward
          the south, and one near the east gate with its door looking toward
          the north. These will be for the Priestly singers, the sweet
          singers in Israel, the Little Flock, singing to God and to the
          people concerning the Kingdom blessings. These immortal ones will
          sing the praises of God for His goodness to those in the spirit
          phase (north) of the Kingdom, and for the blessings flowing from
          Christ's ransom altar (east gate) through restitution to those in
          the earthly (south) phase of the Kingdom.—Ezek. 40:44-46.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the north and
          on the south pavements of the inner court flanking the Temple will
          be the two pairs of parallel priests' chambers (Figures 3 and 5),
          in each pair the inner <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page581">[pg
          581]</span><a name="Pg581" id="Pg581" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          building 100 cubits long and the outer 50 cubits. They will be
          three stories high, the top story narrower than the others and
          leaving galleries facing each other across the 10-cubit way between
          them, into which their doors will open one on each side of the way.
          In these chambers, lighted by narrow windows the priests will lay
          the most holy things, and eat the most holy things, including the
          meat, sin and trespass offerings of prince and people in the
          Millennial Age; humanity having been bought by Christ will make the
          consecration of themselves and their all to Christ, Head and Body.
          The Christ (priest) will accept their consecrations (lay them in
          the priests' chambers) and appropriate them to themselves (eat the
          offerings). In the sacred conditions represented by the priests'
          chambers the priests will have their feasts of love, as they
          rejoice over the consecrated efforts of earth's billions in their
          progress toward human perfection, and thereafter. When the priests
          come out to the outer court with the people they will change the
          holy garments they wore in the priest's chambers and put on other
          garments. The holy garments type the promises and Word of God as
          concerns the Divine immortal nature, and the other garments will be
          the Word and covenant of God as respects things concerning the
          people and their restitution hopes and blessings.—Ezek. 42:1-14;
          44:19, 29-30; 46:19 20.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Temple will
          be built with double walls all around, except the porch in front
          (Figures 3, 4 and 5). This will leave a space within the walls
          termed the <span class="tei tei-q">“side chambers,”</span> in three
          stories reached by winding stairs, and reaching up set quite to the
          top of the Temple inner wall. Each story will be divided into 30
          rooms. The second story rooms will be wider than the first, and the
          third story wider than the second. This will be accomplished by
          making the thick walls thinner each story up. The floor beams will
          rest, not in the walls, but on the recessions of thickness with
          each story. No function is stated by Ezekiel, but the similar side
          chambers in Solomon's Temple were utilized for keeping Temple
          treasures and vessels. In antitype the Temple is the Church, the
          Christ, Head and Body, and in the chambers of memory of the Divine
          Christ will be stored up not only the character treasures of oil
          and incense and of gold and silver and precious stones laid up in
          Heaven during the Gospel Age, but also the like treasures offered
          by mankind throughout the Millennial Age. Only the priests will
          have access to these treasures and the Little Flock will forever
          guard these most precious offerings. The three stories, each wider,
          suggest the character treasures laid up by those on the three
          planes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page582">[pg
          582]</span><a name="Pg582" id="Pg582" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Human, Spirit, and Divine.—Ezek. 41:5-9; 1 Kings 6:5-10; 2 Chron.
          3:9.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ezekiel
          Temple represents God's finished work. The Holy does not type the
          spirit-begotten condition, but rather the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory of
          it</span></em> as a Divinely accomplished work—for the experiences
          of the spirit-begotten condition will never be lost. The Most Holy
          types the accomplished Divine nature. No furniture appears in
          either of these sacred chambers, except in the Holy, an altar of a
          kind of wood not stated—an altar designated as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is the table that is before Jehovah.”</span> If
          it is to be the same as is in Solomon's Temple it will be
          cedar—type of immortality, the Divine nature. No mention is made of
          offerings at this altar, for the time of the Christ's sacrifice
          will be past. The interior of both chambers will be sheathed with
          wood—presumably cedar, type of immortality—up to the narrow windows
          at the top of the inner wall of the Temple. The interior
          decorations of palm trees, alternating with two-faced cherubim,
          with the faces of a lion and of a man, type that the purpose and
          concern of God's glorious Temple will be the administration of the
          affairs of perfect righteous men (palm trees) under the joint
          auspices of Divine Justice and Love. If the two-leaved doors into
          the Holy and the Most Holy are to be of the same wood as in
          Solomon's Temple, they will be of olive, type of the peace of God
          that passeth understanding for those privileged to enter through
          the door of Christ.—Ezek. 41:13-25.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Back of, or west
          of the rear of the Temple, and separated from it by the twenty
          cubits of the separate place will be the western building, a
          structure of inside dimensions 70 by 90 cubits and with walls 5
          cubits thick, making the outside dimensions 80 by 100, or including
          the 20-cubit separate place, 100 cubits square, indicating the
          Divine perfection of the class represented by it. This is not
          connected in any way with the altar or the Holy or Most Holy, and
          its use is not stated. It answers the description of such a class
          of beings as the angels.—Ezek. 41:12-13.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Chambers for the
          Levites.</span></span>—Certain chambers will be set apart for the
          activities of the Levites. Near the outer door of the north gate of
          the inner court (a work done by the spirit phase of the Kingdom) on
          the upper pavement will be a chamber where the Levite will wash the
          burnt offerings of the people. In the porch or lobby of the same
          gate will be four tables of hewn stone, each 1-½ cubits square by a
          cubit high, on which will be laid the instruments for slaying the
          sacrifices, and whereon the sacrifices will be slain and their
          flesh laid out. In the outer court outside the inner court gate and
          beside the steps <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page583">[pg
          583]</span><a name="Pg583" id="Pg583" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          leading up to the gate, will be the four more tables for slaying
          the sacrifices, two on each side of the steps. In antitype, the
          offerers will make or renew the consecration of themselves, under
          the various required conditions, and will be accepted by the Great
          Company (Levites) who will act between the people and the Little
          Flock (priests). The utter consecration of the persons, typed by
          the death of the animals, will be supervised and directed by the
          Great Company, and the offerers will endeavor to conform themselves
          to the character pattern, suggested by the cut stone of the tables
          and the resting of the flesh and the slaughter instruments upon the
          tables. Those offering themselves in heartfelt consecration as an
          expression of their thankfulness to God (burnt offering) will be
          cleansed in character by the teachings of the Word of God (washed
          with water) imparted by the Great Company (Levites).—Ezek.
          40:39-43.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certain of their
          offerings the people are to eat, figuring their assimilation in
          their very beings of the consecrations made. This process will not
          be without fiery trials, ameliorated by the Word of God (hot
          water), chastenings at the hands of the Great Company
          (Levites)—typed by the boiling of the sacrifices by the Levites
          preparatory to their being eaten by the people. This activity of
          the Great Company is typed in the boiling places at the courts in
          the corners of the lower pavement.—Ezek. 46:21-24.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further
          activities by the Levites of thirty kinds in behalf of or in
          cooperation with the people, may be typed in the thirty chambers
          along the lower pavement of the outer court.—Ezek. 40:17-18.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Gates, Doors,
          Porches, etc.</span></span>—In the Tabernacle the gate, the door
          and the veil, all facing the east, typed Christ and in a certain
          sense those in Him. None might enter these holy entrances except
          those having to do, as actual or probationary, participants in the
          sin offering. So in the Ezekiel Temple, in connection with the east
          gate of the outer and inner courts is pictured the entrance of
          those in previous ages having to do with the fiery sufferings
          connected with the sin offering—the Little Flock and the Ancient
          Worthies. The Little Flock is depicted as the glory of God entering
          by the east gate of the outer court and the east gate of the inner
          court, and finally into the Temple (Ezek. 43:1-5), typing the
          progress of the Christ Body through Christ Jesus, as the way (gate)
          into imputed human perfection (outer court) through the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“change”</span> to the Spirit plane (inner
          court) and up to the immeasurable exaltation of the nature of God
          (Temple). After the full entrance of the Body of Christ the outer
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page584">[pg 584]</span><a name=
          "Pg584" id="Pg584" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> gate shall be shut,
          and no one shall enter except the Ancient Worthies, who were
          privileged to enter their honorable estate by the door of
          self-sacrifice unto death. (Ezek. 44:1-3.) In the condition of
          being in Christ, in the mind of Christ, the Ancient Worthies shall
          <span class="tei tei-q">“sit”</span>, communing with Christ and
          with God, assimilating the Word of God (eating), which shall
          strengthen them for their stupendous task of the government and
          regeneration of the whole world of mankind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eastern gate
          of the inner court, the way to the Divine nature through sacrifice,
          will be closed after the entrance of the glory of God, the Body of
          Christ, in whom God dwells, and no one shall ever enter therein, as
          pictured in the parable of the foolish virgins. (Z. '05-267; Ezek.
          46:1). In this gate, in Christ, at the very inner door of the gate,
          having met all the conditions qualifying for entrance upon the
          spirit nature, throughout the Millennium, God's seventh day (the
          Sabbath), and the day of the New Covenant (new moon), the Ancient
          Worthies will have their standing. There in intimate communion with
          the glorified Christ they will make their thankful consecrations of
          themselves and their vows fulfill (burnt and peace offerings),
          having their standing in Him Whom they preceded in suffering, and
          Whom they follow in time and place.—Ezek. 46:1-8, 12.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Entrance at the
          north or south gates of the inner or outer courts signifies, not
          participation in, but benefit from the Sin Offering. The gate
          looking toward the north (spirit phase) types the looking toward
          the Divinely provided ransom. It will be where the people will
          present their sacrifices, and figures their consecrations and their
          acknowledgment of the altar, the blood of Jesus Christ. The gate
          looking toward the south will look figuratively toward restitution.
          Those entering it, too, will acknowledge the blood, for in entering
          it they will face directly toward the altar. On the solemn feast
          days, the people and the Prince entering the north gate must not go
          out by the same gate, but by the south gate, and vice versa. This
          types that every one entering the plane of actual or heart
          perfection on the human plane must acknowledge that the restitution
          (south) blessings were brought by the spiritually (north) provided
          blood of the Redeemer.—Ezek. 40:20-31; 44:4-6; 46:9-10.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The typical
          importance of the gates, doors and porches is emphasized in Ezekiel
          44:5 <span class="tei tei-q">“Mark well, and behold with thine eyes
          (of understanding), and hear with thine ears (of spiritual
          hearing), all that I shall say (write) unto thee concerning all the
          ordinances of the house of Jehovah, and <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page585">[pg 585]</span><a name="Pg585" id="Pg585" class=

          in of the house, with every going forth of the
          Sanctuary.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court gates
          (Figure 6) will be hallways crossing the 50-cubit pavements. The
          size will be 50 by 25 cubits. The outer court gate will be entered
          from a flight of seven steps over the outer threshold through a
          door. The narrow hallway will be flanked by six little chambers
          projecting out one cubit into the hallway, three in a side, and
          will end over an inner threshold in a porch or lobby, frequently
          translated <span class="tei tei-q">“arch”</span>, from which an
          inner door will open into the court. The inner court gate will be
          of identical but reversed construction, the porch or lobby coming
          first. The interior will be dimly lighted by narrow windows. The
          walls along the hallway—the posts—will be adorned with palm trees,
          reminders, antitypically, that the purpose of the entire sanctuary
          is to promote the glory of God by the restoration of mankind to
          perfection (palms). The six little chambers type six conditions to
          be complied with by those actually or at heart on the perfect human
          plane, the size of the chambers—one reed square—signifying that
          each of these conditions embraces the full measure of the Word of
          God (reed)—perfect requirement in that respect.—Ezek. 40:6-43;
          43:1-4; 44:1-5; 46:1-12.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The porch of
          each gate and of the Temple types Christ, as the
          resurrection—<span class="tei tei-q">“I am the
          resurrection.”</span> In the outer court gates the person entering
          will pass the little chambers first and the porch afterward, typing
          that during the Times of Restitution the world of mankind will meet
          the conditions before being fully resurrected to perfection. In the
          inner court gates the porch will come first, signifying that the
          person is first raised to the spirit condition and then is
          developed. In connection with the Temple porch there will be no
          little chambers, typing that the Little Flock will have met all the
          conditions before their exaltation.—Ezek. 40:8-9, 16, 20-22, 24-26,
          33-36, 39-43, 48-49; 41:23-26.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The entrance to
          the Temple will be through a lofty porch, flanked by two great
          pillars. These pillars will be suggestively named, as in Solomon's
          Temple, the right one, Jachin (He shall establish) and the left
          one, Boaz (In it is strength). In these inspiring reminders are
          seen the mighty strength of The Christ, possessors of all power in
          Heaven and in earth, with which God through them will establish His
          Kingdom.—1 Kings 7:13-22.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priests'
          chambers on the upper pavement of the Inner court will be entered
          by a separate gate and separate stairs from the outer court,
          suggesting that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page586">[pg
          586]</span><a name="Pg586" id="Pg586" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          entree to the love feasts of the Little Flock will be exclusively
          for them alone. (Ezek. 46:19). The gates of the city will be twelve
          in number, three on a side, and each named for one of the twelve
          tribes.—Ezek. 48:31-34.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">The
          Altars.</span></span>—As the entire Plan of salvation centers about
          the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, so at the mathematical center
          of the Ezekiel Temple will be the great brazen altar, with its
          rites, and offerings, and the blood, typing the ransom and the
          antitypical sin offering. It will be at the center of both the
          outer court and of the inner court, and of the priests' land and of
          the land divided among the tribes, typical of the world. The court
          gates will all point toward it, and facing it will be the steps,
          porch, and outer and inner doors of the Temple. The construction
          and dimensions of the altar are given in Fig. 7. The brazen altar
          will be 4x12x12 cubits; it will be reached by stairsteps from the
          east, and will rest upon two borders or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“settles,”</span> respectively, 4x14x14 cubits and
          2x16x16 cubits, the lower of which will rest upon a bottom or
          foundation 1x18x18 cubits. The Tabernacle altar was 3x5x5 cubits,
          the dimensions suggesting incompleteness, as compared with the
          numerical symbolism of the Ezekiel altar. This altar types the
          completed work of the Sin Offering and will be seen to be of far
          greater magnitude and importance than even the eye of faith can now
          perceive while the suffering work is in process. Its elevation by
          the bottom and two settles suggests the lofty exaltation of The
          Christ who participated in the Sin Offering far above the
          beneficiaries from the blood—the Great Company and the perfected
          world of humanity. It will be approached by stairs to the height of
          the base of the altar proper, typing that the evidence of the
          sacrifices by the offerers will be carried into Heaven
          itself.—Ezek. 40:44-47; 43:13-27; 45:18-20; 47:1.</p>

          following:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A burnt offering
          will be a thankful prayer to God, acknowledging His mercy, wisdom
          and love as manifested in the broken Body of the offerer's great
          Ransomer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A peace offering
          will be the fulfilment of a vow or a willing thank offering; the
          offerer eating the sacrifice will be his appropriation to himself
          of the consecration; with it he will eat certain things such as
          unleavened cakes, oil and anointed wafers, signifying his faith in
          Christ's character which he will copy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A trespass
          offering signifies reconsecration in connection with restoration
          for wrong, with recognition of the offerer's imperfection and the
          value of the ransom.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page587">[pg
          587]</span><a name="Pg587" id="Pg587" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A meat offering
          of fine flour, unleavened cakes, oil, etc., signifies the
          consecration of the offerer's all, the sample burned on the altar
          meaning the consecration's approval and acceptance by Jehovah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sin offering
          will be an acknowledgment of past sins and of the application of
          the merit of the Ransom, with repentance and reconsecration of the
          offerer.</p>

          and the past defilement of the whole world. The general defilements
          involving all—referring in part to the typical location of the
          palace of Solomon and the kings, close to the Temple—are
          Christendom's defilement of God's holy name by their erroneous
          teachings about Him and by the lives of those evil clergy and laity
          who presumed to bear His name; their <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“whoredoms,”</span> or unhallowed union of church and
          state; their permitting of prominent persons—clergy and laity—who
          were dead in trespasses and sins, to assume elevated places in the
          worship of God; their conjoining the entrance into the Temple class
          (a church) with entrance into places of influence; their
          establishing the same wall of living members of the churches as the
          wall of business and the state; their encouraging unconsecrated
          persons, not spirit-begotten, to serve in the holy things in the
          church as teachers and clergy; their breaking their covenant, made
          solemnly with God in their consecrations; and their not keeping the
          charge of the Divine Word of truth but hiring paid clergymen to
          look after it for them. The great mass of the Spirit begotten
          (Levites) had gone astray from God after their man-made idols of
          earthly honor, power and wealth; and they had served the evil
          tendencies of church members in their idol worship. Between the
          people and the clergy every conceivable abomination in the sight of
          God had been practiced, and will require cleansing and a wholesome
          memory of it, to safeguard against future outbreaks and to manifest
          continual appreciation of the holiness of any service of God.—Ezek.
          43:7-9; 44:6-14.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Offerings.</span></span>—The times of certain offerings, as on the
          sabbaths and new moons, type that the Jews and the world might not
          effectively consecrate themselves until the Millennial Age—God's
          seventh Day and the time of the New Covenant. (Ezek. 44:24; 45:17.)
          The sacrifices by the prince for all the people on the first month,
          first day, type the universal consecrations during the first
          1,000-year Day of blessing for mankind, when all consciences will
          be cleansed by the application of Christ's merit. Those on the
          Seventh day type the same consecration during the Millennium
          regarded as God's great seventh Sabbatical <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page588">[pg 588]</span><a name="Pg588" id="Pg588" class=

          simple minded will be cleansed from sin and set right. (Ezek.
          45:20.) On the fourteenth day the celebration of the passover
          memorial, and the seven-day feast thereafter, picture the memorial
          of the Lamb of God and the feast of thankfulness and consecration
          for the fulness of the New Covenant forever (Ezek. 45:21-24); that
          on the fifteenth of the seventh month, and for seven days, type the
          application of Christ's merit through the Sin Offering and the
          thankfulness and consecration of the people in the Spirit,
          eternally thereafter. (Ezek. 45:25.) The sacrifices and worship of
          prince and people at the east gate, on the sabbaths and the new
          moons, figure the consecrations and reconsecrations of Ancient
          Worthies and people throughout the 1,000-year Day of
          Restitution.—Ezek. 46:1-11.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At any time the
          Ancient Worthies representing the people also may, of their own
          free will express their thankfulness and celebrate the fulfilment
          of their consecration vows, signifying this as their continuing
          state of mind. (Ezek. 46:12). The daily burnt and meat offering for
          the nation, morning and evening, signify the continued thankful
          consecrating of all classes on all planes of being in memory of and
          through, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lamb of God which taketh away
          the sin of the world.”</span> (Ezek. 46:13-15). Throughout the
          Millennial Age this Little Flock will necessarily be in contact
          with defiling and death-dealing error in some, with whom they are
          intimately connected, in process of restoration to human
          perfection; by the close of the great seventh Day, before the
          eighth Day the application of the merit of the Sin Offering will
          have cleansed or destroyed, all such cases and The Christ will no
          more have to be in touch with such defilements. (Ezek. 44:25-27).
          Offerings to cleanse the altar with blood type the memory that the
          altar class—The Christ, Head and Body—were cleansed by the blood,
          and that all offerings are sanctified by the blood. (Ezek.
          43:18-27). Salt cast upon the offerings types the preserving power
          of the Word.—Ezek. 43:23-44.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the

          condition toward which they are progressing, as their inalienable

          No ruler, or other power, is to interfere with this right, nor
          teach them otherwise. (Ezek. 46:13; 48:29.) The Hebrews, the
          original beneficiaries, are to welcome the rest of mankind and
          treat them as of their own number.—Ezek. 47:22-23.</p><span class=

          (Ezek. 44:24; 45:6.) They are to receive the instructions of the
          Christ.—Ezek. 44:23.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through the
          Ancient Worthies, the rulers of the earthly phase, the people are
          at heart to consecrate their all, typed by offerings of tenths or
          multiple thereof. (Ezek. 45:13-25.) To The Christ they are to
          consecrate their hearts' best endeavors, their firstfruits, and
          everything which they dedicate by vow or consecration. (Ezek.
          44:29-30.) The Great Company they are to love, and to them they
          must be loyal.—Deut. 14:27-29.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people must
          be thoroughly cleansed in conscience. (Ezek. 44:9). They are to put
          away all their former defilements and abominations and are to
          worship and serve God throughout the Times of Restitution and
          thereafter, observing that holy period as a solemn feast to the
          Lord. (Ezek. 43:6-7; 46:1-3, 9-10; 45:17.) They are to consecrate
          themselves daily, with thankfulness, with repentance and
          restitution for sin, and with vows fulfilled.—Ezek. 44:29-30; 45:1,

          (Ezek. 45:8-9). They are to see that the commercial intercourse of
          the people is on a just and equal basis for all. (Ezek. 45:10-12).
          They will receive taxes or offerings from the people, with special
          attention to the spiritual offerings symbolized by the things
          offered. (Ezek. 45:13-16). The land they are to keep holy, as they
          will their own condition of favored perfection, symbolized by the
          land. (Ezek. 48:21-22). Certain ones for special merit—such as any
          during the Gospel Age who lived up to their consecrations as mere
          believers, not being taught the things of the Spirit, and as those
          through devoted loyalty making special progress during the
          Millennium—they may cause to have the same honored position as
          themselves, which will be permanent if the recipients manifest the
          spirit of sonship, but lasting only to the close of the 1,000 years
          to those failing to show this spirit. (Ezek. 46:16-17). They will
          be privileged, as favored participants in the application of the
          Sin Offering merit, to go in and out of the outer court east
          gate—as in the place of Christ—and there to feed upon the meat in
          due season from Christ's bounty. (Ezek. 44:1-3). In all holy things
          they are to be the leaders of the people. (Ezek. 46:9-10). They
          are, during the entire Millennial Age—God's sabbath—to make
          offerings (Ezek. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page590">[pg
          590]</span><a name="Pg590" id="Pg590" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          45:17-25) of thankfulness, praise and recognition of the ransom,
          directly through the Christ with whom they shall be in intimate
          relations.—Ezek. 46:1-12.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Duties and
          Privileges of Levites.</span></span>—On account of Gospel Age
          disloyalty the Great Company, while enjoying the Spirit nature
          (Numb. 18:23-24), will occupy an inferior place as servants—not
          priests—in the service of God. (Ezek. 44:10-14). Their lower nature
          on the spirit plane will be inalienable and unchangeable. (Ezek.
          48:13-14). Rather than serve in the Temple at all, they are to
          render service at the various gates, for whatever functions are
          typed at or by the gates. (Ezek. 44:11). Rather than do the direct
          service of Jehovah, they will continue as in the Gospel Age when
          they courted and served the desires and lusts of the people—to
          serve directly and perpetually the people rather than the direct
          interests of their God. (Ezek. 44:11-12). They shall not come near
          to God nor approach to an appreciation of the things of the Divine
          nature, but they shall do whatever menial services there may be
          given them by the Little Flock to do. (Ezek. 44:13-14.) It will be
          their part to receive and make effective the consecrations of the
          people, to cleanse them with the water of the Word, and to
          administer the stripes and chastening, many or few, tempered by the
          water of the Word, whereby the people may thoroughly assimilate
          (eat) the significance of their consecrations. They may possibly
          restore the literal sacrifices of animals as object lessons (Z.
          '05-269).—Ezek. 40:35-43; 46:21-24.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">Duties and
          Privileges of the Priests.</span></span>—The Little Flock, the
          Church, will enjoy the nature of God, who Himself, in His nature,
          will be their inheritance and possession. (Ezek. 44:27-28, Numbers
          18:20.) They will serve the Divine purposes in direct and intimate
          contact with their Father, Jehovah, and will continue to keep the
          charge of God's holy doctrines and truths, as they faithfully kept
          it during the Gospel Age. (Ezek. 40:46; 44:15-16; 45:4; 48:10-12.)
          They will continue having charge of God's house, His Church, His
          people. (40:44-45; 44:8.) They will be in various grades of honor
          (houses), as <span class="tei tei-q">“star differeth from star in
          glory.”</span> (Ezek. 45:4.) They alone will have the privilege of
          entering the Divine Temple, or Christ class. (Ezek. 44:15-16.) They
          will forever regard their blessed condition most holy, most
          consecrated to Jehovah. (Ezek. 48:12.) They will keep the law of
          Divine Love in all its manifestations and judge the people
          according to that exalted standard (Ezek. 44:24, Deut. 17:8-13);
          teach all mankind to know the pattern of true godliness in all its
          particulars and to discern between holy and secular, good
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page591">[pg 591]</span><a name=
          "Pg591" id="Pg591" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and evil (Ezek.
          43:10-12; 44:23); sanctify and bless humanity according to the
          Oath-bound Abrahamic Covenant on terms of willing obedience. (Ezek.
          44:19, 30; 46:19-20.) These priests will make union with and make
          fruitful the various covenants and promises (wives) by God,
          avoiding those not Divinely approved. (Ezek. 44:22; Lev. 21:7,
          13-14.) They will receive tithes of the Levites. (Numbers
          18:25-32.) All dedicated things will belong to them—that is, all
          covenants, vows and consecration of the people will be made to the
          Christ. (Ezek. 44:29-30; Josh. 6:19; Lev. 27:20-34; Numbers
          18:8-20.) Theirs will be the charge of the altar—of applying the
          merit of Christ to the people (Ezek. 40:44-46), and they alone
          shall make the offering to God, declare the Divine forgiveness and
          approval of the people and of their consecrations.—Ezek. 43:18-27;
          44:15-16, 25-27; 45:18-25; 46:1-7, 11-24.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-family: sans-serif">The Life-Giving
          River.</span></span>—The benefits of Divine Love flowing to save
          and bless all the willing and obedient of mankind are pictured in
          the Life-Giving River. From underneath the threshold, the place of
          rulership, the Throne of The Christ (Rev. 22:1), the water of the
          Word of Divine Love flows forth. Under the favor of the Church
          (right of Temple) the truth about the loving mercy through the
          blood of Jesus Christ (altar) is for the restitution of all in the
          earthly (south) phase of the Kingdom. (D. 650, 655; Z. '05-269; Z.
          '99-196; Ezek. 47:1.) Through Christ, the Gate, with all His loving
          favor (right) it flows toward the Sun-rise. (Ezek. 47:2.) The same
          one—Pastor Russell—who measured the race for the mark of the prize,
          with the line of Divine Righteousness (love, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the fulfilling of the law”</span>), measured also the
          requirements for character attainment of the Millennial Age. One
          who will have that degree of love, which is duty love to God and
          man, even though reaching the utmost fulness of the measure of
          Divine Justice (1,000 cubits), will be as it were, only up to the
          ankles in the stream. He who attains the fulness of the Divine
          standard as to love for God, for His glorious character, will be in
          the stream to his knees. He who shall reach the fulness of love for
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“least”</span> brethren of that Age
          will be up to the loins; but he who so acquires the spirit of
          Divine Love, as to love all, including his enemies, will have
          reached the utmost fulness of love. (Ezek. 47:2-5.) Any that
          appreciate this, see the full purpose of Divine Love. It is
          important—<span class="tei tei-q">“Son of man, hast thou seen
          this?”</span> (Ezek. 47:6.) This is the love that will insure the
          healing of the sin-sick, anarchistic world lying in a deadness like
          the Dead Sea. (A. 318, D. 653, Z. '99-196, Ezek. 47:7-8.) Whoever
          becomes immersed in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page592">[pg
          592]</span><a name="Pg592" id="Pg592" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the fulness of Divine Love shall thereby gain life; and for
          everyone everywhere, to whom the water comes, there shall be life.
          (E. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">357</span></span>, 335; C. 214; Ezek. 47:9.)
          In connection with the gospel of the fulness of Divine Love there
          shall be a multitude of fishers of men to spread the net of the
          gospel of glad tidings of great joy for exceeding many. (C. 215,
          Ezek. 47:10.) But the people who are hopelessly polluted with
          worldliness (miry places) and those impregnated beyond saving with
          miasmas of iniquity (marshes) shall not be healed even when
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brought to an accurate knowledge of the
          truth.”</span> (Ezek. 47:11.) And the stream of the truth of Divine
          Love shall cause many righteous ones to come up (Dan. 12:3) whose
          loving teachings shall never be forgotten nor its character
          fruitage ever pass away; for they shall bring forth continued
          fruitage, because of the Divine Truth of perfect love coming to
          them out of Zion, the glorified Church. And the character fruitage
          shall forever be for spiritual food (John 4:34) and the teachings
          (leaves) for the healing of all the willing and obedient of the
          sin-sick world of mankind.—Z. '05-269; Matt. 10:8; Mal. 4:2; Ezek.
          47:12.</p>

          just, and loving Creator prevail, we are alarmed to notice that the
          tendency with all who abandon this long revered doctrine is toward
          doubt, scepticism, infidelity. Why should this be the case, when
          the mind is merely being delivered from an error?—do you ask?
          Because Christian people have so long been taught that the
          foundation for this awful blasphemy against God's character and
          government is deeplaid and firmly fixed in the Word of God—the
          Bible—and consequently, to whatever degree their belief in
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hell”</span> is shaken, to that extent
          their faith in the Bible, as the revelation of the true God, is
          shaken also;—so that those who have dropped their belief in a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hell,”</span> of some kind of endless
          torment, are often open infidels, and scoffers at God's Word.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guided by the
          Lord's providence to a realization that the Bible has been
          slandered, as well as its Divine Author, and that, rightly
          understood, it teaches nothing on this subject derogatory to God's
          character nor to an intelligent reason, we have attempted in this
          booklet to lay bare the Scripture teaching on this subject that
          thereby faith in God and His Word may be reëstablished, on a
          better, a reasonable foundation. Indeed, it is our opinion that
          whoever shall hereby find that his false view rested upon human
          misconceptions and misinterpretations will, at the same time, learn
          to trust hereafter less to his own and other men's imaginings, and,
          by faith, to grasp more firmly the Word of God, which is able to
          make wise unto salvation; and on this mission, under God's
          providence, it is sent forth.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
